      "title": "Show HN: AI Tarot Reading – get instant 1/3-card or (past/now/future) readings",
      "summary": "Description:\nI built AI Tarot Reading, a simple web tool that lets you pull a tarot card (or three cards representing past / now / future) and ask a question to get a reading. The idea is to make the tarot experience accessible, quick, and just a little mystical — whether you’re just curious, seeking insight, or playing around. Key features: Choose 1 card (for a focused answer) or 3 cards (past-, present-, future-style) Enter your question and then the cards are drawn instantly Readable interpretations accompany each card so you can get some insight immediately No app install required – runs fully in browser Why I made it:\nTarot has always fascinated me. I found a lot of existing tools either too heavy (lots of decks, lots of options) or too shallow (just random card flip but no context). I thought: what if I build something clean, minimal, fun, where someone can just ask “What’s going on with X?” and pull a reading in 30 seconds?\nAlso, I’m curious how folks will use it — for serious reflection, or just for fun. I hope it brings a moment of stirring thought, or maybe just entertainment. Tech stack / implementation notes: The card draw is random but seeded so each session is unique Interpretations are standard tarot-style meanings, adapted for readability UI is minimalist, mobile-friendly Gotchas: It’s meant for fun/reflective use only (not predictive or therapeutic advice) Open questions / for feedback: Would a “custom deck” option or more spread types (5-card, Celtic cross, etc) be valuable? How much depth do users want in the interpretation? (Short snippets vs longer explanations) Any suggestions for UX: maybe save readings, share with friends, log over time? I’m also thinking of adding a “theme” mode (love, career, creativity …) — worth it? If you’re at all interested in tarot, reflection tools, or just want a quirky bit of code/play, check it out and I’d love your feedback. Thanks! — Thanks for reading.
