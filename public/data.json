      "summary": "While working on a proof of concept project, I kept hitting Claude's token limit 30-60 minutes into their 5-hour sessions. The accumulating context from the codebase was eating through tokens fast. So I built a language designed to be generated by AI rather than written by humans. GlyphLang GlyphLang replaces verbose keywords with symbols that tokenize more efficiently: # Python\n  @app.route('/users/')\n  def get_user(id):\n      user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", id)\n      return jsonify(user)\n\n  # GlyphLang\n  @ GET /users/:id {\n    $ user = db.query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?\", id)\n    > user\n  }\n\n  @ = route, $ = variable, > = return. Initial benchmarks show ~45% fewer tokens than Python, ~63% fewer than Java. In practice, that means more logic fits in context, and sessions stretch longer before hitting limits. The AI maintains a broader view of your codebase throughout. Before anyone asks: no, this isn't APL with extra steps. APL, Perl, and Forth are symbol-heavy but optimized for mathematical notation, human terseness, or machine efficiency. GlyphLang is specifically optimized for how modern LLMs tokenize. It's designed to be generated by AI and reviewed by humans, not the other way around. That said, it's still readable enough to be written or tweaked if the occasion requires. It's still a work in progress, but it's a usable language with a bytecode compiler, JIT, LSP, VS Code extension, PostgreSQL, WebSockets, async/await, generics.

      "title": "Ask HN: If AI wins, don't AI companies lose?",
      "summary": "Let's play it out in the case of software engineers. 100 SWEs all running Claude Code. Okay, company is 10x more productive than before. Now, company cuts 90% of SWEs because AI makes 10 engineers as productive as 100 engineers. Yay, company saves 90% of engineering costs. But now, 10 engineers run Claude Code. And now Claude revenue drops by 10x multiple? So if AI gets good, it will reduce the very engineering headcount that AI companies depend on, right?
