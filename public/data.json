      "summary": "I have been thinking about this new research direction for AI all year. I believe it is an error to even call the field AI rather than just simply intelligence or machine intelligence, as the framing largely influences how people approach this. We have literally been transferring different aspects of human intelligence to the machines and we are probably very close to being able to transfer everything now.
