      "summary": "If there are folks here that work on LLM providers on managing the compute server/workload orchestration on training or inference side, I'm curious what's the state of the art in this area is. I understand Kubernetes has a fair amount of frameworks for training and serving, but I assume it's not the best tool for running large-scale GPU clusters (at least not out of the box). Many cloud providers started providing ultrascale but low-pod density Kubernetes clusters for this. I also assume there are still many orchestrators like Slurm still around for these kinds of job, and I remember Open AI trying to build their own orchestrator for training jobs. I also assume spatial locality between servers, infiniband/RDMA also matter a lot more than Kubernetes provider native support for, and server health story must be completely different since GPUs fail a lot more often, and they have a lot more interesting metrics to monitor on top of standard OS metrics. What are some articles or blogs to read in this space to come up to speed on how GPU/ML compute orchestration happens in the state of the art today?

      "summary": "Ever experienced building something, deploy it to Vercel, just to find out that something didn't work as expected, but worked on local even with prod flags? That's why I built return0 - tired of debugging why the production environment made the code behave differently - like - why did my endpoints hang (example: node module didn't work in the production environment - silently caught error. In this case I had to modify the 3rd party node module, redeploy the code, add console.logs, took hours to figure out) - or, why was the code pointing to wrong hosts in production (reason: environment variables) - and more. Usually to fix it you'd add logs here and there, that might surface some information. But, it's time consuming & tedious, and not the best developer experience. return0 dynamically figures out what information to extract, like variable states. In your AI IDE - with the help of the return0 MCP server - simply explain the issue in the chat window, and it will find the root cause based on live variable states from the deployed code - like a local debugger would. And no redeployment of the code is necessary to extract more information, return0 includes an SDK that enables this dynamic tracing of your code. You also don't need to tell what information to extract.
