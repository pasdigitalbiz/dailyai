      "summary": "I’ve been building a small framework called HOLO that locks state and continuity for AI systems instead of treating each session as stateless.\nIt uses containment math and CAP-style rules to preserve context and rebuild identity on restart.\nI’m looking for two or three engineers or researchers who’ve wrestled with context drift or continual-learning issues and want to test persistence models together.\nRepo/demo available on request — this post is just to find the right people.\nHolo.Simulations@gmail.com Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45854558 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "GitChat – Branch AI chats on a canvas like Miro meets ChatGPT and Notion",
      "summary": "I've been building GitChat as a side project to solve fragmented brainstorming in AI chats (linear threads bury ideas). So I wanted a non-linear space to visually connect thoughts. It's an AI chat app where you branch conversations across a dynamic canvas: pin websites, docs, images, and reference them in any thread for seamless collaboration. Think Miro's visual boards + ChatGPT's smarts + Notion's organization. Supports multiple AI modes (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, Google, and more) Early beta, so expect rough edges; no mobile yet. Feedback welcome! Requires an invite code to get your account activated though. Lmk if you need one! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45854253 Points: 1 # Comments: 1",

      "summary": "Hi HN, I'm Eagien, the creator of PixSprout ( https://pixsprout.com ), an AI tool that turns text or images into custom stamp designs. I built it after seeing a friend who runs a stamp business spend hours in Photoshop manually designing hundreds of layouts for customers every day. I thought — why not automate it? So I built PixSprout to generate realistic stamp-style designs with AI in just seconds. You can try:\n- Text to Stamp Generator → https://pixsprout.com/text-to-stamp - Image to Stamp Maker → https://pixsprout.com/image-to-stamp You’ll need to sign up to generate and save results, but everything runs directly in your browser — no downloads or setup needed. I’d love your feedback! What customization options or new tools would you want for stamp design? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45853505 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",
