      "title": "Bridging the gap between fast-evolving code libraries and AI models",
      "summary": "I’ve been working on an idea to make coding LLMs much smarter about new or less-known libraries. Right now, when developers use fresh packages or new versions, most AI coding tools fail multiple times because they don’t have context about those APIs—they end up searching the web and hallucinating. My project aims to fix that by indexing packages and version, and exposing them through a unified API that LLMs (or AI agents) can query directly. The system would understand which version the user’s environment uses, explain why a symbol is missing or deprecated, and suggest alternatives or migration paths. Do you think this is a valuable direction for improving AI-assisted coding tools? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45843594 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "summary": "After losing $50K to emotional trading, I built ZennyTrader - an AI app that detects emotional patterns (FOMO, revenge trading, overconfidence) and intervenes before costly mistakes. What makes it different:\n- Clinically validated by licensed psychologist\n- Real-time interventions (cooling periods when emotions spike)\n- Shows correlation between emotions and P&L\n- Backed by peer-reviewed research Currently in Apple review. Offering lifetime founding memberships ($399) to first 50 users. Built with React Native, Node.js, Supabase. Happy to answer technical or trading psychology questions.
