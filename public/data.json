      "title": "Google Backing Bitcoin Miners Marks a Quiet $5B Shift Toward AI",
      "summary": "Google is quietly shaking up both the Bitcoin mining world and the AI infrastructure game. Instead of buying up data centers or mining rigs themselves, they’re backing Bitcoin miners with at least $5 billion in credit guarantees. They do this through long-term AI hosting leases, often teaming up with companies like Fluidstack. Basically, Google steps in as the financial safety net, which suddenly lets these risk-heavy mining firms get the kind of financing that’s usually reserved for serious infrastructure projects. It’s a big shift: those unpredictable crypto miners are turning into stable, reliable operators of AI data centers. With Bitcoin mining getting less profitable and way more unpredictable, a lot of miners are jumping at the chance to lock in steady income through long-term AI and high-performance computing contracts. For Google, this isn’t just about making money. It’s a smart way to secure things like electricity and real estate stuff that’s getting harder to find without sinking a ton of money into ownership or drawing too much attention from regulators. They also keep the door open for future profits if these ventures take off. Of course, this approach isn’t risk-free. There are real concerns about how concentrated things could get, how operations might run into trouble, and what regulators might say. Plus, as more miners focus on powering AI instead of securing the Bitcoin network, less energy goes into keeping Bitcoin itself safe. In the end, this isn’t just a minor tweak it’s a real shakeup. Mining, money, and infrastructure are all getting rewired, moving away from chasing crypto rewards and toward fueling the AI boom.

      "title": "Show HN: Semantic geometry visual grounding for AI web agents (Amazon demo)",
      "summary": "Hi HN, I’m a solo founder working on SentienceAPI, a perception & execution layer that helps LLM agents act reliably on real websites. LLMs are good at planning steps, but they fail a lot when actually interacting with the web. Vision-only agents are expensive and unstable, and DOM-based automation breaks easily on modern pages with overlays, dynamic layouts, and lots of noise. My approach is semantic geometry-based visual grounding. Instead of giving the model raw HTML (huge context) or a screenshot (imprecise) and asking it to guess, the API first reduces a webpage into a small, grounded action space made only of elements that are actually visible and interactable. Each element includes geometry plus lightweight visual cues, so the model can decide what to do without guessing. I built a reference app called MotionDocs on top of this. The demo below shows the system navigating Amazon Best Sellers, opening a product, and clicking “Add to cart” using grounded coordinates (no scripted clicks). Demo video (Add to Cart):\n[ https://youtu.be/1DlIeHvhOg4 ]( https://youtu.be/1DlIeHvhOg4 ) How the agent sees the page (map mode wireframe):\n[ https://sentience-screenshots.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.co... ]( https://sentience-screenshots.sfo3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.co... ) This wireframe shows the reduced action space surfaced to the LLM. Each box corresponds to a visible, interactable element. Code excerpt (simplified): ```\nfrom sentienceapi_sdk import SentienceApiClient\nfrom motiondocs import generate_video video = generate_video(\n    url=\" https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/ \",\n    instructions=\"Open a product and add it to cart\",\n    sentience_client=SentienceApiClient(api_key=\"your-api-key-here\")\n) video.save(\"demo.mp4\")\n``` How it works (high level): The execution layer treats the browser as a black box and exposes three modes: * Map: identify interactable elements with geometry and visual cues\n* Visual: align geometry with screenshots for grounding\n* Read: extract clean, LLM-ready text The key insight is visual cues, especially a simple is_primary signal. Humans don’t read every pixel — we scan for visual hierarchy. Encoding that directly lets the agent prioritize the right actions without processing raw pixels or noisy DOM. Why this matters: * smaller action space → fewer hallucinations\n* deterministic geometry → reproducible execution\n* cheaper than vision-only approaches TL;DR: I’m building a semantic geometry grounding layer that turns web pages into a compact, visually grounded action space for LLM agents. It gives the model a cheat sheet instead of asking it to solve a vision puzzle. This is early work, not launched yet. I’d love feedback or skepticism, especially from people building agents, RPA, QA automation, or dev tools. — Tony W Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46333526 Points: 1 # Comments: 1",

      "summary": "I got tired of checking multiple GitHub repos to see what's new with CC, opencode, etc., so I threw together a cli tool. Right now it fetches the latest changelog entries from CC and opencode, as well as gemini, codex, and gh-cli. Example commands:\n- `aic claude` : Latest Claude Code changelog\n- `aic latest` : All releases from the last 24 hours\n- `aic codex -json` : JSON output for scripting The `aic latest` command is what I use most — shows any releases from the past 24 hours across all supported tools, sorted by date. It pulls from GitHub releases or CHANGELOG.md files depending on the project. Output available as plain text, JSON, or markdown. Install via brew, scoop, go, or build from source.

      "summary": "I have this strong desire to leave everything to help the small to mid farmer earn more. I can’t just accept that they make so little money working so hard while everyone in between eats their lunch. Even if I can’t fix the pipeline, I can at least try to make them more efficient, have fewer losses, or operate like a big Ag at a smaller scale. Anyone here doing any use of LLMs, ML or just any software tech in general? How’s that going?\nWere you in ag? \nGetting any traction?\nAre farmers receptive?\nAnything you want to share would be great, would also pay a coffee to chat.
