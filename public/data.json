      "title": "Why Every Business Must Engage with AI – and How to Do It Right",
      "summary": "Title: Why every business should engage with AI (the real question is how deep) AI is no longer an experimental technology. It’s becoming a baseline capability for modern businesses. The real question most teams should be asking is not “should we use AI?” but “how deeply should we engage with it?” I’ve talked to many founders, CTOs, and operators over the past couple of years. The hesitation around AI usually comes from two places: Teams that haven’t really tried AI and feel comfortable sticking with existing workflows. Teams that rushed into AI, spent money, got disappointing results, and walked away. Both often conclude: “AI isn’t for us.” That conclusion is understandable — but increasingly risky. Many organizations still rely on manual or semi-manual processes: document handling, internal knowledge search, reporting, customer support triage. Everything appears to “work,” but it’s slow, hard to scale, and dependent on headcount rather than leverage. AI isn’t magic, but it is a force multiplier. Ignoring it means accepting structural inefficiency while competitors gradually improve speed, quality, and decision-making. One misconception I see a lot: that engaging with AI means building custom models or hiring a large ML team. In practice, AI today is closer to what spreadsheets or search once were — general-purpose tools that most teams can benefit from without deep specialization. Instead of treating AI adoption as a yes/no decision, it’s more useful to think in levels. Level 1: AI literacy\nEvery company should be here. This is about enabling people, not systems: using tools like ChatGPT for research, drafting, summarization, and analysis; teaching teams how to verify outputs; and setting clear rules around sensitive data. Low risk, high return. Level 2: AI-assisted workflows\nHere AI becomes part of everyday processes without replacing humans. Examples include internal AI assistants over documentation, AI-supported customer support, content generation, or analytics help. This is where many teams see the best ROI with relatively low complexity. Level 3: AI-driven systems\nAt this level, AI is embedded into products or core operations: RAG systems, agent workflows, forecasting, personalization. This requires clean data, evaluation, and operational discipline. Many failures happen here not because AI doesn’t work, but because teams skip the earlier foundations. The biggest risk isn’t “doing AI wrong.” It’s not building AI fluency at all while the rest of the market moves forward. Once AI systems are in production, new problems appear: cost control, reliability, hallucinations, latency, silent regressions. At that point, AI stops being a demo and becomes infrastructure. For teams already dealing with production AI systems, we’ve been thinking a lot about observability and reliability in this space. Some of that work is shared here:\nhttps://optyxstack.com/ai Curious how others on HN think about the “depth” question when it comes to AI adoption.

      "title": "AI Agents That Execute Business Workflows (Claude Code for ERP)",
      "summary": "TL;DR: Built an ERP where AI agents execute workflows like procurement and invoice processing. Uses Cases (workspaces) and Tasks (sessions) like Claude Code. Agent completes one task, automatically triggers the next. Mac app live, looking for early users. Mac App: https://apps.apple.com/be/app/swiftly-ai-native-erp/id6755155607?mt=12 TestFlight: https://testflight.apple.com/join/aYc16FmA THE PROBLEM After 8 years implementing ERPs across Europe, I kept seeing the same issue: ERP systems store data but can't execute processes. Employees still manually click through forms for invoicing, procurement, onboarding. WHAT WE BUILT AI agents that execute multi-step business workflows autonomously. Example: Vendor Procurement Case: \"Source Steel Pipes - Q1 2026\"\n  \n  Task 1: Research Suppliers → finds 3 vendors\n  Task 2: Compare Pricing → creates comparison\n  Task 3: Negotiate → drafts proposal, waits for approval\n  Task 4: Create PO → auto-triggered after approval Each task has specific instructions. Status changes trigger next tasks. You approve key decisions. Everything is auditable. HOW IT'S DIFFERENT Workflow engines (Zapier): Rigid rules that break\nRPA tools: Brittle scripts\nAI chatbots: Just answer questions Swiftly: End-to-end execution with approval gates WHAT'S INCLUDED Full ERP/CRM underneath: AP/AR, Projects, Time Tracking, Contracts, Inventory, Customer Management. The AI workflow layer sits on top. Tech: SwiftUI apps, Swift/Vapor backend, PostgreSQL, Anthropic Claude. We are looking to expand to all 8 major AI providers:\nAnthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Perplexity, xAI Grok, Cohere, Mistral, DeepSeek WHAT WE NEED We have our first paying customer. Looking for: - Early users willing to define 2-3 workflows with us\n- Feedback on the Case/Task system\n- SMEs (1-10 employees) in service businesses 7-day free trial. €10/seat/month after.
