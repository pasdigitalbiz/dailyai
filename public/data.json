      "title": "AI Art Tool Is Changing Everything (Goodbye Midjourney?)",
      "summary": "AI art is everywhere — but let’s be honest, most platforms make creativity complicated, expensive, and sometimes even unsafe. That’s why I built *Artistorial* — a platform where anyone can create stunning, high-quality AI images without needing to pay huge monthly fees or expose their private prompts to the world. Here’s what makes *Artistorial different from Midjourney, Leonardo, Ideogram and others:* --- ####  *1. Private Generation for EVERYONE — Even Free Users* Most platforms like Midjourney generate images publicly in Discord servers.\nYour ideas, prompts, and creations are visible to other users unless you pay for “stealth mode.”\n*Artistorial is different:*\n Every user — free or paid — gets *private generation by default*\n Your images stay in your dashboard only\n No public galleries unless you choose to share\n Your ideas remain yours. --- ####  *2. Affordable, Creator-Friendly Pricing* Creating beautiful AI art shouldn’t cost $30–$60 every month. | Artistorial gives you: * *Free Plan* → 2000 credits/month (private generation!)\n* *Pro Plan* → 20,000 credits/month + AI Editor + Character Creator\n* *Premium Plan* → Unlimited credits + full features\n   Making professional AI creation affordable worldwide. --- ####  *3. No Discord. No Complications. Just Create.* Midjourney works only through Discord commands.\nFor new users, that means: * Learning prompts through chat bots\n* Public visibility of your generations\n* No simple “Upload & Edit” interface\n  *Artistorial is built like a real creative app:*\n   Clean dashboard\n   Drag-and-drop image upload\n   Real-time AI image editor & character creator\n   Mobile-friendly & web-based\n   Anyone can use it — no prompt knowledge required. --- ####  *4. High-Quality Images (Even for Free Users)* Some platforms reduce quality for free users or add watermarks.\nAt Artistorial: *  Ultra HD / 4K outputs\n*  Crystal-clear textures, lighting & shadows\n*  Wide styles — realistic, fantasy, anime, surreal, cyberpunk, posters, thumbnails, logos\n*  No watermarks on any plan. --- ####  *5. AI Avatars, Character Creator & Image Editing — Built In* Midjourney can generate images — but it can’t edit them, fix faces, remove backgrounds, or create consistent characters over time.\nArtistorial gives you:\n AI Avatar from your own photo\n Character Consistency (same face in multiple scenes)\n AI Image Editor (remove objects, modify styles, expand, re-paint)\n Background removal, upscaling, lighting correction\n It’s not just image generation — it’s full image creation & editing . --- ####  *6. Your Privacy Matters* Many platforms store your data or use your images to re-train AI models.\nAt Artistorial: *  Your images stay private\n*  No public usage unless you allow\n*  Secure Supabase storage + API authentication\n*  GDPR-friendly & user-controlled deletion --- ###  *So… Why Choose Artistorial?* You pay less.\n You get more creative control.\n Your images stay private.\n You don’t need Discord.\n You get high-quality AI + editing + avatars in one place. --- Try it now → [www.artistorial.com](http://www.artistorial.com) Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45717625 Points: 1 # Comments: 2",

      "title": "Show HN: AI that uses image context to translate and redraw manga",
      "summary": "Hi HN, As a huge manga fan and a translator by training, I've always been in awe of the incredible amount of work that fan translators put in. The process isn't just about translation; it involves manually cleaning the original text from the bubbles, redrawing the background art (inpainting), and then carefully placing the translated text back in (typesetting). It's a true labor of love, but it's incredibly time-consuming. I wondered if modern AI could help automate the most tedious parts of this workflow. So, I built AIFandom. It's a web tool where you upload your manga pages, and it extracts the text from the speech bubbles and translates the text, but with a key difference: The model doesn't just read the text, it also looks at the visual context of the panel to better capture the original tone and nuance. Then, It automatically removes the original text, uses an inpainting model to intelligently redraw the artwork that was behind the text, and then typesets the translated text back into the bubbles. The end result is a fully translated and readable manga page that you can download. I use gemini for the translation process and various models for OCR, inpainting, masking, rendering. It's not a free tool. This whole process is computationally expensive and requires a good amount of GPU time. To cover these costs, I've priced it at $7/month for 1000 pages. However, I really want you to see the quality for yourself, so there is a 50-page free trial for everyone to test it out, no credit card required upfront. I would be incredibly grateful for your feedback. - How is the translation quality and tone?\n- Does the automatic typesetting look natural to you?\n- Is the pricing fair for the value it provides?\n- What features should I prioritize adding next? Thanks for checking it out! I'll be here all day to answer any questions. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45716885 Points: 3 # Comments: 0",
