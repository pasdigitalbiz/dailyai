      "title": "Top AI-Tech Startup Ideas for 2026",
      "summary": "Whenever people see a title like this, the expectation is usually a list of shiny ideas powered by the latest models. But the AI startup ideas that are most likely to matter in 2026 don’t come from novelty, they come from economics finally working. AI isn’t creating new desires or behaviours. It’s making long-standing, expensive, and frustrating workflows cheap enough to automate. Compliance reviews, internal ops, customer support triage, sales admin, reporting, the kinds of tasks people complain about every day, but tolerate because “that’s just how it works.” What’s different now is that many of these problems can be solved by very small teams. Things that once needed large ops groups or heavy process can now be handled by focused AI systems with clear ROI. While researching this, I noticed the same complaints showing up across different industries and communities. Different words, same pain. Over time, I started collecting these patterns, which turned into startupideasdb, not as a list of predictions, but as a way to ground AI SaaS ideas in repeated, public frustration. you can google startupideasdb:com I’m curious how others here think about 2026.\nWhat problems feel boring today, but suddenly feel inevitable to automate?

      "title": "AI-Augmented Memory for Groups",
      "summary": "Hi HN, We’re building Largemem, (https://largemem.com) a shared knowledge base where groups upload and maintain a common set of documents (PDFs, scans, audio) and query them conversationally. Each group has its own persistent knowledge base. We parse content into chunks, extract entities, and combine vector search with a lightweight knowledge graph, so answers can synthesize information across multiple documents and across the group’s shared context—not just retrieve isolated snippets. We would love to hear your feedback! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46285155 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",
