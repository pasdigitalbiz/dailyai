      "title": "Are others seeing early-stage funding shift from AI apps to infrastructure?",
      "summary": "I’ve been tracking early-stage funding and founder movement across AI, deep-tech, and infra for several months, and a pattern keeps repeating: Capital is quietly rotating from apps → infra. Not the hype-cycle rotation — the real, structural one. Signals I’m repeatedly seeing:\n• inference infra growing  \n• retrieval pipelines getting funded  \n• data systems / cyber infra cooling less  \n• apps (especially wrappers) slowing  \n• founders moving to deeper layers What’s interesting is that this shift isn’t loud.  \nIt’s forming underneath the narrative, not above it. My question to the HN community: Are you seeing similar signals — in your teams, companies, investment decisions, or founder circles? Not promoting anything — just exploring the signal.
