      "summary": "Right now many companies are in cost-cutting phase, so here is an AI thought experiment. 50% less white collar jobs -> 50% less productivity SaaS apps needed (slack, gmail, notion, jira, msft word, many more...)

But AI can work directly with databases and store data more efficiently. What now? (FWIW, I do think AI is very useful. I use it daily to help me with engineering work. No arguments there.)
