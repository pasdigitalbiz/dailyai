      "title": "Show HN: We built an AI Humanizer to fix unnatural AI writing",
      "summary": "Most AI-written text isn’t obviously wrong.\nGrammar is fine. Facts are usually fine.\nWhat gives it away is the tone. We kept seeing the same patterns: sentences with identical rhythm, over-explained transitions, and a kind of “smoothness” that doesn’t match how people actually write. AI detectors try to flag these patterns, but chasing detectors felt like treating the symptom, not the cause. So we built a small AI Humanizer that works at the sentence level. Instead of masking signals or applying prompt tricks, it rewrites text to improve flow, vary structure, and reduce repetition — aiming for writing that simply reads more naturally. The tool doesn’t try to guarantee that text will pass any specific detector. Different detectors behave differently, and that changes all the time. Our goal was narrower: make AI-assisted writing feel intentional and human-readable again. This started as an internal experiment while working on AI detection, and we decided to make it public to see how others approach the same problem.
