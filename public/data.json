      "title": "Show HN: Agentlearn – Interactive course for AI agent fundamentals",
      "summary": "https://agentlearn.dev I built agentlearn after noticing that most AI agent tutorials focus on frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI) rather than fundamentals. The result is developers who can copy-paste code but struggle when things break. This is a free, interactive course covering: The Agent Loop - Why loops matter (think vs. act vs. observe)\nContext Engineering - The real skill behind \"prompt engineering\"\nTools & Function Calling - Bridging text generation to real actions\nMemory Systems - Short-term vs. long-term, vector DBs\nProtocols - MCP, A2A, and the emerging standards\nProduction Patterns - Error handling, cost optimization, observability\nEach concept has runnable code sandboxes you can step through. The design is intentionally \"hand-drawn\" to feel less intimidating than typical technical docs. Tech stack: Vanilla JS + Vite, no framework. Why no framework? Because understanding fundamentals means understanding what frameworks abstract away. Once you get the core loop, you can use any framework—or build your own. Feedback welcome! Especially interested in what topics are missing. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46522985 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "summary": "I see lots of posts about using 5-10 agents in coding, and how amazing LLMs are at coding, especially Claude code. I do use both claude and chatgpt (that in vscode and codex), usually start with a planning conversation, then tell them to start and have hold points to test and discuss. Neverythelss, reading some posts I feel like I am not making the most of it and achieving the full capability and throughput. Keen to see some people share details on how they set-up their coding environment and the practical process for handling the agents.
