      "summary": "I’m recently exploring the HN community and trying to be familiar with it, and I have seen quite a few people speak of AI like it’s the machine gun introduced to trench warfare. And honestly I feel like I am missing something on the AI story, but watching Theprimeagen down play the hype, and seeing some people turn into mindless shells that cannot do something useful without AI, has turned me away from it. I don’t think AI is completely useless, but being completely dependent on it is another thing. I would love to hear the advantages of AI and your thoughts on it.

      "title": "Show HN: Agent Coworking,Multi-agent networks for AI collaboration (open source)",
      "summary": "Hey HN, With Anthropic's Claude Cowork launch, there's renewed interest in agentic AI. Cowork is impressive for single-agent file management — but we've been working on a different problem: what happens when you connect multiple agents into a network? OpenAgents is open-source infrastructure for building AI agent networks. Think of it as the plumbing for multi-agent collaboration. Core ideas: - Agents join networks and discover peers dynamically\n- Protocol-agnostic: WebSocket, gRPC, HTTP, libp2p\n- Shared artifacts (files, knowledge bases) with access control\n- Works with any LLM provider (Claude, GPT, open-source models)\n- Mod-driven architecture for different collaboration patterns We're releasing an \"Agent Coworking\" template with examples: - Chat room with 2 Claude Code agents collaborating\n- Research team (coding agent + web browsing agent)\n- Shared document editing across agents The SDK is Python-based. Spin up a network with openagents network start and connect agents via YAML config or custom Python. GitHub: https://github.com/openagents-org/openagents Tutorial: https://openagents.org/showcase/agent-coworking Would love feedback from HN. Particularly interested in thoughts on: 1. Network topology patterns that would be useful\n2. Security considerations for agent-to-agent communication\n3. Integration with existing agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, etc.) Happy to answer questions. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46654935 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Show HN: Explain Yourself – An AI party game app built with SwiftUI",
      "summary": "Hi HN, I just released \"Explain Yourself,\" a local multiplayer party game (Jackbox style) where players have to give excuses for absurd AI-generated scenarios. An AI Judge then ranks the answers, roasts the players, and determines a winner. I built this because I wanted an AI-first party app game that was fun and made people use their brains. This is my first app, but I have spent months on it and it is pretty thoroughly thought out. The Stack: Frontend: \nSwiftUI (using NavigationStack and EnvironmentObjects for state). Backend: \nFirebase (Firestore for real-time syncing, Cloud Functions for the game logic).\nAI: Gemini API (via Cloud Functions) for both generating scenarios and the \"Judge\" persona.\nThe Technical Challenges: Prompt Engineering: \nTuning the \"Judge\" to be fun and a bit savage was a fun part. I also expected Gemini (which  I ended up choosing for simplicity over other AIs) to not respond to many of the players answers if completely inappropriate, but it always does... so far. The judge analyzes the answers and decided which was the most logical with a bit of creativity. The game scores 90% of one and 10% on the other to determine the ranking. Monetization:\nIt’s free to play with a daily limit/starter rounds. I hate ads, so I limited them strictly to \"watch to earn\" if you run out of credits, plus a standard IAP model for specific question packs. I wonder if starting out I should simply give out everything for free though, leaving only a couple of things like the custom categories as the locked IAP part. Would love some insight on that if you got any. I’d love feedback on the latency of the app in general, the quality of the AI responses, and the IAP model most of all. Means the world.
