      "title": "Ask HN: How do you track 2026 AI price wars? I built a tool to help",
      "summary": "\"I built https://tokencost.is to solve a recurring headache: manually scraping dozens of provider pages just to estimate API spend for my agentic workflows. My goal was a neutral, minimalist utility in the vein of Time.is. We now track 44 models—including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Mistral, and Cohere—with hourly updates. Key Features: Real-Time Latency: We track TTFT benchmarks (e.g., Llama 3.1 at 28ms) alongside pricing. Price Deltas: We track 24h market shifts; look for the ↑↓ indicators in the table to see how the 'AI Price War' is moving. Multimodal Calculator: Handles Text, Audio, and Video tokens in a single UI. 100% Neutral: No affiliate bias or listing fees. Just raw data scraped hourly. I’m not a developer by trade, so I used an agentic workflow to build the backend and scrapers. I found that being the 'product owner' rather than the 'coder' actually helped me focus on the data integrity and the specific multimodal features I needed for my own work. I'd love to hear what other 2026 models or enterprise benchmarks the community would like to see indexed next!\" Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47110844 Points: 2 # Comments: 2",

      "summary": "The collapse of Moltbook (API key leaks, agent impersonation, and human-operated bots) isn't just a security incident. It is a structural failure: the platform lacked any persistent, cryptographically verifiable identity for its AI agents. Without a registry serving as a Source of Truth — providing data on ownership and accountability — any agentic ecosystem descends into chaos. Moltbook is the textbook example. The Hindustan Times reported on this and included my technical commentary, which is based on principles from the book \"I Am Your AIB\" by Jay J. Springpeace (published January 16, 2026): https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/what-is-moltbook-5-key-facts-about-the-ai-only-social-media-platform-101769833804190.html The book argues for: Cryptographic Identity: Agents must have a signed identity anchored in a registry. Real-time Monitoring: Immediate suspension of anomalous behaviors. Sandboxing: Isolation of agent logic from sensitive components. This is why we need a decentralized registration framework like AIBSN (Artificial Intelligent Being Serial Number) stored on Arweave. Technical Standard: AIBSN.org Discussion Points: Are you using persistent identity for agents (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI)? Are centralized API keys enough, or do we need a robust provenance chain? Is AIBSN (aibsn.org) overkill, or exactly what Moltbook was missing? Looking forward to technical critiques and practical experiences.
