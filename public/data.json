      "summary": "Three weeks ago, we just launched an open-source computer-use agent: https://github.com/zfoong/WhiteCollarAgent However, we are currently looking for self-hosted and easy-to-set-up microVM solutions for the agent's GUI mode. The idea is to let agents operate in an isolated environment for its GUI operation, like web-browsing, launching an app, and using the app, etc. Anyone with any experience with microVM, feel free to let me know in the comments.

      "title": "Why autonomous AI agents fail in production",
      "summary": "Most AI agent demos look impressive. They plan tasks, call tools, self-correct, and complete workflows end-to-end.\nBut when teams try to deploy them in production — especially where money, safety, or compliance is involved — the same problems appear again and again. Not because the models are inaccurate, but because the system is structurally unsafe. Here are the failure modes I keep seeing: Non-replayable decisions\nAgent behavior depends on implicit context, dynamic reasoning, and probabilistic paths.\nWhen something goes wrong, you can’t reliably replay why a decision was made. Probabilistic components with execution authority\nLanguage models generate plausible outputs, not deterministic decisions.\nGiving them final execution power creates an unbounded risk surface. No hard veto layer\nMany agent systems “try another tool” or “fill in missing intent” instead of failing closed.\nThat’s resilience in demos, but risk amplification in real systems. Ambiguous responsibility\nWhen an agent acts autonomously, it becomes unclear who actually approved the action.\nIn regulated or high-consequence domains, this alone blocks deployment. The core issue isn’t intelligence — it’s accountability. In production systems, AI can be extremely valuable as: a semantic interpreter a risk signal generator a decision-support component But final decisions must remain: deterministic replayable auditable vetoable by humans Until agent architectures treat controllability as a first-class requirement, autonomy will remain a demo feature — not a production one.
