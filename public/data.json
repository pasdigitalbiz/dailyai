      "title": "Show HN: AI pentester – verified exploits, $999/assessment",
      "summary": "I spent 20 years in security, most recently leading 100+ engineers at AWS building pentesting infrastructure across thousands of services. The same problem everywhere: pentests take weeks, cost $15-50k, and the results are stale before they ship. I built Cipher to fix that. It's an AI agent that reasons like an attacker — maps the target, finds vulnerabilities, chains them into exploits, and proves they're real. Every finding ships with a reproducible Python script. If the script doesn't break your system, we don't report it. How it works: Cipher defines security invariants (\"User A can't access User B's data\"), then multiple agents attack in parallel to violate them. A separate judge agent tries to disprove every finding — if it can't reproduce the exploit 3 times, the finding dies. You never see it. $999 per assessment. Results in ~2 hours. Unlimited retesting. Honest limitations: complex multi-step auth flows (SSO with MFA) still need manual setup like providing JWT credentials. We're working on it. I'll run Cipher free for the first 15 HN readers who want to try it. Drop your email or sign up at https://apxlabs.ai/ . Happy to answer any questions about the approach.

      "summary": "Built an MCP server that turns Reddit sentiment into options signals. 185k LOC, 9-stage AI pipeline, now live with 90 users on just day 1. Wall Street pays millions for retail sentiment data. It's free on Reddit. I realized: instead of another dashboard, just expose it as an MCP tool. Users ask Claude \"what's unusual in options right now\" and get structured signals instantly. Results: 9,000 GitHub clones in 5 days, 52% win rate on 50 live trades (backtest was 58.8% on 129 trades—classic overfitting), 18.4% visitor→signup conversion. https://web-production-71423.up.railway.app/mcp-server Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47056745 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",
