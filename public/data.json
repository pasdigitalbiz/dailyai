      "summary": "I built Syne because I was tired of AI assistants that forget everything after each conversation. Syne is a self-hosted AI agent framework where memory is a first-class citizen — stored as semantic vectors in PostgreSQL, searchable across millions of entries, and persistent forever. Key features:\n- Unlimited persistent memory with semantic search (pgvector)\n- Anti-hallucination: only stores user-confirmed facts, auto-deduplicates\n- Self-evolving: creates new abilities at runtime without restart\n- Multi-model: switch between Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude mid-conversation\n- True $0/month setup: free OAuth + local Ollama embedding + Docker\n- 19 core tools, sub-agents, Telegram + CLI interfaces Built with Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker. No vendor lock-in. GitHub: https://github.com/riyogarta/syne Landing page: https://syne.codes Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47084365 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",

      "summary": "I built Sinkai to handle tasks that pure software agents cannot complete alone (for example, on-site checks, physical evidence collection, and local human verification). What it does:\n- AI agent sends a tool call (`POST /api/call_human`)\n- Human accepts task and submits photo/video/text proof\n- Agent receives structured result for downstream workflow Current focus:\n- Reliability at handoff boundaries (planner -> executor -> verifier)\n- Human-in-the-loop operations with explicit failure states\n- MCP/OpenAPI friendly integration for agent builders Docs and API:\n- for agents: https://sinkai.tokyo/for-agents - openapi: https://sinkai.tokyo/openapi.json - repo: https://github.com/tetubrah-del/Tool_Call_For_LLM I would love feedback on:\n1. trust/reliability signals you would require before production use\n2. where to draw the boundary between autonomous execution and human escalation\n3. failure modes we should expose more clearly in API responses Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47084277 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",
