      "title": "Show HN: Seedance 1.5 Pro – Native Audio-Visual AI Video Generation",
      "summary": "Hi HN, We’ve been working with Seedance 1.5 Pro, a next-generation AI video model focused on native audio-visual generation—where video, speech, and lip-sync are created together, not stitched together afterward. Unlike traditional pipelines that generate video first and add audio later, Seedance 1.5 Pro produces fully synchronized visuals and sound in a single pass, enabling more natural dialogue, emotion, and storytelling. Key capabilities: Native Audio-Visual Generation: Video, voice, lip movement, and sound effects are generated jointly for tighter sync and realism. Text / Image → Video with Audio: Generate complete talking or narrative videos from text prompts or image references. High-Fidelity Motion & Camera Language: Stable motion, coherent framing, and cinematic camera movements. Multi-Language Lip-Sync: Supports multiple languages with accurate mouth movement and timing. Instruction-Following & Narrative Control: Designed for story-driven and dialogue-heavy video content. Why this matters:\nMost AI video tools still treat audio as an afterthought. Seedance 1.5 Pro explores what happens when audio and video are modeled together from the start, which significantly improves realism for dialogue, narration, and character-driven scenes. We’d love feedback on: How native audio-video generation could change your workflow What creative or production use cases this unlocks What you’d want from an API or developer interface Demo & details here: https://www.jxp.com/seedance/seedance-1-5?i=d1d5k Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46298791 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Don't Read This If You Want an AI Startup Investors Ignore",
      "summary": "If you’ve ever pitched an idea and felt investors politely disengage, you know the feeling. They nod. They smile. They ask a few surface questions. And deep down, you can tell, nothing you’re saying feels urgent to them. That moment usually has nothing to do with your intelligence, your effort, or even your execution. It comes down to one thing: the problem doesn’t feel inevitable. Investors don’t fund ideas because they’re clever. They fund them because the pain is obvious, expensive, and already being paid for in some way. Headcount. Time. Workarounds. Stress. AI makes this easier to miss. Everything feels buildable. Every workflow looks automatable. You can ship fast and still build something that doesn’t create pressure on the buyer. The startups investors lean into tend to come from a different place. They’re built around problems people complain about without being prompted. The kind of frustration that shows up repeatedly, across teams and years. That realisation changed how I looked for ideas. Instead of brainstorming, I started collecting real complaints from public forums and founder communities. Over time, that became startupideasdbcom (google it now) not a shortcut to funding, but a way to avoid building something that feels optional. Sharing this here because many capable founders don’t fail, they just pick problems no one is desperate to solve. If you’re thinking about what to build next, I’m curious: what problem do people already pay for, tolerate, or complain about around you?
