      "title": "Ask HN: Is there something like Google style guide for AI-only coded apps?",
      "summary": "The Google style guide for C++/Java/Python are opinionated, hard fought, wise, and they elimate a large source of errors while minimizing harmful, unneded inconsistences.  They picked a style that made great realistic use of the best cognition at the time. The intent is still great, but now we should think about writing good general rules for building programs that are essentially all AI generated.  What generic wisdom leads to flexible, auditable, composable and robust apps and systems? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47204331 Points: 1 # Comments: 1",

      "title": "I built AI agents that do the grunt work solo founders hate",
      "summary": "Hey HN, I'm a solo founder. Every morning I was spending 2 hours doing the same things: checking competitors, reading AI news, monitoring my Stripe dashboard, looking at Google Trends for content ideas. So I built Seleci to automate all of it. What it does: You pick a template (Market Pulse, Revenue Radar, Trend Scout), click deploy, schedule it, and every morning you get a clean markdown report — no code, no Zapier flows, no prompt engineering. How it works under the hood: FastAPI backend with an agentic loop (tool-calling LLM with web search, Stripe API, Google Trends)\nPer-tool rate limiting to prevent runaway agent loops (web_search capped at 3 calls/run)\nReact/Vite frontend, Supabase auth, deployed on Koyeb + Vercel\nThe agent actually executes tools and returns structured results — not a chatbot wrapper\nWhat it's NOT: Not another ChatGPT skin\nNot a no-code workflow builder (no nodes, no drag-and-drop)\nNot trying to replace developers — it's for the founder who doesn't have one\nLive demo: https://seleci.com I'm applying to YC with this. Would love brutal feedback from HN via Discord — what's missing, what's broken, what would make you actually use this?
