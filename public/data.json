      "title": "Built an AI-powered profit calculator and inventory tracker app for resellers",
      "summary": "I'm a developer who got into flipping/reselling as a side hustle last year. My biggest frustration was standing in thrift stores trying to figure out if something was worth buying while juggling eBay sold listings, Google searches, and fee calculators. So I built Underpriced.app - an AI reseller app that tells you if something is worth flipping before you buy it. The Problem Researching items takes ~5 minutes per item\nYou waste time and miss deals while researching (someone else grabs it)\nYou buy blindly and hope for the best\nSpreadsheet tracking is tedious The Solution Take a photo or screenshot → AI identifies the item → Get instant analysis:\nProfit potential after all fees\nROI percentage\nDemand level & time to sell\nBest platforms to sell on\nRed flags to watch for\nDeal score (0-100) Tech Stack Frontend: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS\nBackend: Node.js, PostgreSQL\nChrome Extension for browser integration Features I'm Proud Of Works for both online sourcing (screenshots) and in-person (photos)\nBuilt-in flip tracker with analytics & reports\nChrome extension for one-click online deals analysis\nPremium AI tools: flipping strategy, listing generators, deep market research\n15-30 second analysis time Current Status Launched 2 months ago\n10 free analyses to start\nPaid tiers from $2.99/mo\nActive users in flipping community What I'm Working On\nMore accurate valuations for niche items\nMulti-item batch analysis\nMobile app (currently PWA)\nIntegration with inventory management tools Lessons Learned\nAI vision models are incredible but need heavy prompt engineering\nPromoting SaaS is way harder than building it\nThe reselling community is way bigger than I expected\nBalance between speed and accuracy is crucial Try it: underpriced.app Would love feedback from fellow builders: How would you improve the AI prompts for better accuracy?\nWhat's a fair price for this kind of analysis tool?\nShould I focus on depth (better analysis) or breadth (more features)?\nHappy to answer any technical questions about the build!

      "summary": "Frasier is one of my favorite shows of all time. I love the characters, the writing, the acting, the whole kit and kaboodle. I've been watching it on Prime and it's been driving me insane how drivel and nonsensical their season and episode AI overviews are. Here is the overview for season eight: In the eighth season of Frasier we meet Daphne and Niles post elopement and dealing with Donny suing Daphne. Meanwhile, Frasier reluctantly becomes 'mentor' to station KACL's young new owner, Silicon Valley billionaire Kenny Daly Niles and Daphne elope in season ten!\nKenny Daly is the lovable station manager, not the new owner! What is going on? Amazon's a billion fucking dollar company. Just pay for IMBD's overviews. Oh, that's right, Amazon owns IMDB because of course they do. I am so sick and tired of this AI slop infecting everything. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46508324 Points: 31 # Comments: 4",
