Something like Grammarly for Japanese.\nIt includes generative AI, but it will only highlight areas for improvement, similar to Grammarly. If you have some feedback or comments, please let me know. I want to improve this product and help you. It requires Google sign in, so little bit shame, sorry. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45741442 Points: 1 # Comments: 2",
