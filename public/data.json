      "title": "Show HN: Lexiso – Authorization layer for AI agents that spend money",
      "summary": "We built Lexiso because I kept running into the same question: when AI agents start making purchases, who decides what they're allowed to spend? Today, if you're building an AI agent that buys things (shopping assistant, procurement bot, subscription manager), you either: - Give it your card and hope for the best\n- Build custom authorization logic yourself\n- Don't let it spend money at all None of these scale. Lexiso is the missing layer. It's an API that sits between your agent and any payment system: 1. Register your agent\n2. Define policies (amount limits, merchant restrictions, time windows)\n3. Call /authorize before any purchase\n4. Get a signed yes/no decision in <300ms\n5. Full audit trail for compliance The response is cryptographically signed, so you can prove later exactly what was authorized and why. Site: https://lexiso.app Live API: https://api.lexiso.app Docs: https://lexiso.app/docs npm: npm install lexiso Looking for feedback from anyone building agents that touch financial workflows. What's broken? What's missing? Would you use this? Technical details:\n- Go backend, PostgreSQL\n- RSA-2048 signatures on all decisions\n- Designed for AP2 compliance (Google's agent payments protocol)\n- No custody, no money movement – authorization only Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46804225 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Don't Automate Chaos: The \"100x Rule\" of Factory AI",
      "summary": "I spent years working at Sysmex (medical devices) and Toyota Group (automotive parts) in Japan. With the current AI boom, I see many companies trying to inject \"Silicon Valley logic\" (move fast and break things) into manufacturing floors. In my experience, this usually leads to what I call the \"PoC Graveyard.\" In the physical world, bugs aren't just Jira tickets—they are injuries, recalls, or broken lines. I argue that before writing any code, we must follow the \"100x Rule\": Non-Standardized Process + AI = 100x Chaos Standardized Process + AI = 100x Profit If you automate a mess, you just get a faster mess. I put together my thoughts on why \"Standardization\" must strictly precede \"Automation,\" along with a 5-step checklist I use to diagnose factory readiness.
