      "summary": "Hi Hacker News, This is definitely out of my comfort zone. I've never programmed DSP before. But I was able to use Claude code and have it help me build this using CMajor. I just wanted to show you guys because I'm super proud of it. It's a 100% faithful recreation based off of the schematics, patents, and ROMs that were found online. So please watch the video and tell me what you think https://youtu.be/auOlZXI1VxA The reason why I think this is relevant is because I've been a programmer for 25 years and AI scares the shit out of me. I'm not a programmer anymore. I'm something else now. I don't know what it is but it's multi-disciplinary, and it doesn't involve writing code myself--for better or worse! Thanks!

      "title": "Ask HN: Is the window for local-first AI closing?",
      "summary": "I've spent 20 years building backend systems and the last 12 on cloud infrastructure. Now I'm betting the other way. The thesis isn't \"local AI is better.\" It's that the window to build credible alternatives is closing. Apple, Google, Amazon are all watching local inference become viable. Their response will be \"local\" AI that phones home - on-device processing with cloud-mandatory features, privacy marketing with telemetry requirements. Once those defaults ship, it doesn't matter if alternatives exist. Most people never look for options once something convenient is already there. Search, social, mobile, cloud - the pattern repeats. The question I keep asking: does building local-first alternatives matter if they don't win market share? My current answer is yes - the existence of a credible exit changes how platforms behave, even if most users never take it. But I'm also aware this could be cope. The self-hosting crowd has lost every major battle. Email, messaging, social - private options stayed niche every time. Maybe AI is different because the models are finally capable at small sizes. Maybe it isn't. Building something in this space. Curious if others see the same window, or if I'm just rationalizing a preference into a market.
