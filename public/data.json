      "summary": "Negotiation is one of the few skills that still feels deeply human. But with new tools like TrustX (an AI that finds fair prices and closes deals automatically), we’re entering a strange new phase — where “getting a good deal” might soon be handled by algorithms, not people.

      "summary": "Hey HN, I'm Martino and I built Showcase to solve a problem my team kept hitting: we'd have these incredibly useful ChatGPT conversations with tons of context built up, but there was no good way to bring teammates in without copying/pasting everything or starting over. What makes it different: Real-time collaboration - Multiple people can chat with AI simultaneously, seeing each other's prompts and responses live 180+ models - Compare responses across Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and others in the same conversation Rich media support - Upload videos, audio files, PDFs, spreadsheets, code, even entire websites as context Generate content - Create podcasts, images, and videos directly in the chat Voice responses - Models can respond with audio instead of text The core insight: AI conversations shouldn't be isolated. When you're debugging code, researching a topic, or drafting something, it's way more productive when your whole team can jump into the same context thread. We're using it internally for everything from technical documentation to customer research analysis. The ability to throw a 40-minute video into the chat and have the whole team ask questions about it has been surprisingly powerful. Would love to hear what you think. What workflows would benefit from collaborative AI chat in your work? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45776990 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",
