      "summary": "Look, I know. There are like 47 of these apps already. I'm aware.\nBut here's the thing - I kept trying them and they all took forever (30+ min processing), need to be a prompt master or charged $200 for 5 photos. So I built one that does it in 60 seconds from any selfie. The pitch is simple: LinkedIn, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, your mom's WhatsApp profile pic - whatever. Upload a selfie, pick a style, done. Let people go wild with it. Tech stuff: Swift app, nano-banana, no face training required. It's style transfer that keeps you looking like yourself, just better lit. Free trial, no credit card. Built it solo from Braga, Portugal.\nHappy to talk about the tech or explain why entering the most saturated App Store category seemed like a good idea at the time.
