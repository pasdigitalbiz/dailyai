      "summary": "I paid $20 for Cursor Pro on Jan 14. After 3 days, tokens were exhausted and performance became unusable. I requested a refund on Jan 17 (within 7 days). Their AI bot \"Sam\" denied multiple times, then human \"Charlene\" denied saying \"reflects usage\" for 3/30 days. Now they've kicked me back to the AI bot. Is this normal SaaS practice now? 3 days = no refund for full month? Transaction: #395540957397 Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46664901 Points: 2 # Comments: 1",
