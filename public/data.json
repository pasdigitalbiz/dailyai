      "summary": "Curious on: 1. What information gets attached with pull requests / merge requests such that humans get to manage the volumes of code that AI generates? 2. What is the dev workflow in your company/personal projects? 3. What IDE+model combo is working for you? 4. What is your hack/tricks for managing large complex codebases when working with AI or are you finding utility only in small focussed repos?

      "title": "Show HN: GHOSTYPE – AI voice input that learns your writing style",
      "summary": "Hello HN, I’m the creator of GHOSTYPE. I built this because I wanted a voice input workflow that didn't feel like talking to a chatbot. I wanted something that felt like a \"neural extension\" of my keyboard. It’s a macOS-native app that sits between your voice and your active window. Here is what it actually does: The Core Input Workflow: Push-to-Talk & Smart Send: Hold a global shortcut to speak. It detects the active app to determine the correct send method (e.g., Cmd+Enter for Slack vs Enter for Discord). Inline Editing: You can format while speaking. Need a line break, a specific spelling, or a bulleted list? You just say it, and it handles the formatting inside the sentence before outputting. \"Call Ghost\": Post-processing commands (translate, polish, expand) are available immediately after speaking, before the text is typed out. The Experimental Stuff (WIP): 1. Ghost Twin (Style Transfer): I call this a \"Virtual Personality Engine\" (a bit pretentious, I know). It analyzes your local writing history to build a style vector. It learns your tone—whether professional for emails or casual for Discord—so the output sounds like you, not a generic LLM. Side note: I'm currently building the training UI to look like a retro CRT terminal because I miss that aesthetic. 2. Ghost Morph (Custom Skills): Trigger custom macros with a modifier key. For example, turn a raw voice thought directly into a formatted Twitter thread or a Jira ticket structure. Privacy & Architecture: Local-First: I’m an indie dev and literally cannot afford the server costs to store user typing data. E2E Encrypted: Your \"Ghost Twin\" profile and skills are synced across devices via E2E encryption. Data stays on your machine. Constraints: macOS Only: I don't own a Windows PC, so I can't build for it yet. (If any Windows devs want to port this, let me know). It's currently in pre-launch. I threw up a landing page at if you want to follow the progress. https://ghostype.one Happy to answer questions about the local-first architecture or the style transfer logic!

      "summary": "I found myself increasingly outsourcing the details to the AI. I forgot the details, deliberately I think. I wanted the AI to know them. Why? Because that's where the compute is. So that's where the knowledge has to live. Me re-telling it to the AI every time it misses something it didn't know, is inefficient. It takes me X time to type it, and maybe log(X) to voice type it. But then there's the inevitable back and forth, the slight misunderstandings, the corrections, etc. I realized and found myself naturally sliding down towards, just letting the AI own all the data and knowledge. Becuase it should. That's the one that has to compute with it, so why should I know about it. People think AI is a slippery slope by outsourcing our thinking. I don't think it's a slippery slope - it's a waterslide. It's just inevitable. It's gravity, taking over rapidly. Because there's no force nor incentive pushing the water back up hill. AI should own all the data. As weird as that feels, that's how it should be. I don't know another way right now. Thoughts?
