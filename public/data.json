      "title": "Show HN: Hive Agent – Embed Claude Code-like AI agents in your app",
      "summary": "Hey HN, I've been building with Claude Code daily and kept thinking: what if I could give my users the same experience — an AI agent that explores context, plans, executes tools, and builds things — but embedded natively in my own application? So I built *Hive Agent*, an open-source TypeScript framework that reproduces the core Claude Code architecture as a library you can integrate into any app. *What it does:* - *Workspace system* — Give the agent any context via a virtual filesystem. Feed it your user's data, project files, API responses — whatever your app needs. The agent reads, writes, and searches through it using bash-like commands.\n- *Built-in Explore & Plan agents* — Just like Claude Code, Hive auto-spawns sub-agents to investigate workspace data before acting and to design step-by-step plans for complex tasks.\n- *Sub-agent orchestration* — Spawn specialized agents with different models (Claude, OpenAI), different tools, and structured I/O. A research agent can use GPT-4, while the main agent uses Claude.\n- *Custom tools* — Define any tool your app needs. API calls, database queries, browser automation, document generation — the agent calls them as needed.\n- *Stateless & serverless-ready* — No persistent state. Works in Firebase Functions, Vercel, AWS Lambda. Pass history in, get history out.\n- *Execution tracing & cost tracking* — Full hierarchical traces with per-model token usage and cost breakdown.\n- *Interactive mode* — Agent can pause and ask clarifying questions, just like Claude Code does. *What you can build with it:* - AI coding assistants scoped to your platform\n- Document generators that understand your users' context\n- Project scaffolding tools\n- Support agents with access to your internal APIs\n- Any workflow where an AI needs to explore data, plan, and act *Quick example:* ```typescript\nimport { Hive, ClaudeProvider } from '@alexnetrebskii/hive-agent' const agent = new Hive({\n  systemPrompt: 'You are a project generator...',\n  tools: [myApiTool, myDbTool],\n  llm: new ClaudeProvider({ apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }),\n  workspace: new Workspace({\n    paths: { 'user/requirements.json': { value: userReqs } }\n  })\n}) const result = await agent.run('Create a new project based on my requirements')\n``` The agent will explore the workspace, plan the approach, create files, call your tools — all autonomously. *Links:* - GitHub: https://github.com/anetrebskii/hive-agent - Install: `pnpm add @alexnetrebskii/hive-agent`\n- MIT licensed I'd love feedback from anyone building agent-powered features. What tools or patterns would you want built-in? Try it out and let me know what breaks. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46909873 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",
