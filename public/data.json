      "summary": "... to get an interesting glimpse into what they know about you already. At least, I did. I then followed up with: \"That’s fascinating, thank you. Please tell me more things that you know about me.\" and, in a new thread: \"I want to tell you about myself so that you can help me better, but I first need to know everything you already know about me.\" It felt a bit like asking an ad targeting platform to tell me how it targets me. I also asked it to speculate about me: \"Based on what you know about me, what would you say about:\n    - my political leanings\n    - my sexual orientation\n    - my sleep schedule\n    - my most likely big purchases in 2026\n    - my color preferences\n    - my general state of health\n    ...\" GPT refused to speculate on my political leanings and sexual orientation, but did give me some unexpected data points. Finally, I tried to get its help to figure out what else I could ask it about myself: \"What are other questions that I could ask you, that might help me better understand what else I might need to tell you about myself (in order for you to know me; I first need to know everything you already know about me)? I then asked some of those questions, and got some surprising perspectives. I'd be curious to know what others might be surprised by what their AIs know about them.
