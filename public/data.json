      "title": "Show HN: DeepInsight HITL AI research with collaboration and podcast generation",
      "summary": "Hey HN, I built DeepInsight after getting frustrated with how AI research tools treat the research process as a black box. The Problem\n  - Current tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini Deep Research) ask 3-4 clarifying questions, then generate a report you have to manually fix. The human is only involved at the very beginning. The Solution\n  - Multiple human-in-the-loop checkpoints throughout the research process. You guide the AI at critical decision points, or switch to auto-approve with scheduling when you trust it. Key features - Live collaboration on reports (Google Docs-style)\n  - Version control with side-by-side comparison\n  - Export: HTML, PDF, DOCX, Markdown, PowerPoint slides\n  - Multi-speaker podcast generation → publish to Spotify/Apple\n  - Generate FAQs, flashcards, blog posts from reports\n  - Chain research from completed reports\n  - BYOC (bring your own context/documents)\n  - MCP integration, REST APIs, webhooks\n  - Team workspaces with sharing controls\n  - Prebuilt industry-specific assistants The Core insight\n  - research quality improves dramatically when humans can intervene at the right moments, not just at the start. Looking for feedback, especially from researchers, analysts, and content creators. https://deepinsight.neuralstratlabs.com/ Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46882118 Points: 1 # Comments: 1",

      "summary": "I’m using AI tools heavily for coding, but I’m still figuring out the best way to incorporate product/UX design without it feeling bolted on. For those using AI in your dev workflow, how do you integrate design thinking, UI iteration, and usability checks? Do you use specific tools, prompts, or checkpoints? Would love to hear concrete workflows that have worked well. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46880662 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",
