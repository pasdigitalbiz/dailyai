      "summary": "Hey HN! I'm tired of the ritual where we assume AI needs a GPU cluster and a prayer to avoid crashing. I built BESTBRAIN Core to prove that intelligence—real, deterministic, safe intelligence—can live in the \"room at the bottom.\" This is a 12KB kernel designed for robotics where failure isn't an option. What it is:\n- 12KB decision kernel (10.7KB Python + 1.8KB JS wrapper)\n- 100% deterministic (same input → same output, always)\n- 0 crashes across 10,260+ tests\n- <1ms latency (edge-deployable)\n- No GPU, no neural nets, no randomness What it's NOT:\n- Not a trajectory planner\n- Not a perception system\n- Not a learning algorithm\n- Those belong in user space, not the kernel Why I built this: Everyone's racing toward bigger models. I went the other direction: smaller, simpler, provable. The robotics industry has this ritual where we throw NumPy (15MB), SciPy (31MB), and TensorFlow at every problem. I asked: \"What if we just... didn't?\" Result: A kernel that fits in L1 cache and makes decisions you can actually audit. Try it now:\ngit clone https://codeberg.org/ishrikantbhosale/bestbrain-core.git cd bestbrain-core && python3 -m http.server 8000\nOpen http://localhost:8000/demo.html in your browser Why local? Codeberg doesn't render HTML directly (security). This setup runs the actual Python kernel, not a hosted simulation. You can inspect the code yourself.
