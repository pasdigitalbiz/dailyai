      "title": "Ask HN: How would you distribute a privacy-first AI chat for teams?",
      "summary": "Hi HN, I’m looking for advice on distribution and positioning for a privacy-first AI chat system we’ve been building. We have two open-source pieces: - Conduit — a native mobile client for Open WebUI (GPL). It started as a personal project, but now has teams using it and asking for things like SSO, reverse-proxy auth, and security reviews.\n- Onera — a privacy-first AI chat backend + client where conversations are end-to-end encrypted, with models running inside TEE enclaves. The operator (including us) can’t see conversation content. The client is fully open source and auditable. The users we’re seeing are:\n- companies already using Open WebUI who want a mobile client\n- teams that want a hosted or self-hosted AI chat but don’t want the operator to access message data\n- privacy or security-sensitive orgs (internal tools, regulated environments, etc.) What we’re struggling with isn’t building, it’s distribution:\n- How do teams usually discover tools like this?\n- Is it better to lead with \"Open WebUI ecosystem\" or \"private AI chat\"?\n- For companies evaluating something like this, what actually matters early on (audits, reference deployments, integrations, etc.)? If you were building or buying something like this, how would you approach getting it in front of the right users?

      "title": "Show HN: Mukoko weather – AI-powered weather intelligence built for Zimbabwe",
      "summary": "Zimbabwe has 90+ towns and cities, a population of 15+ million, significant agricultural and mining sectors — and almost no weather infrastructure built specifically for it. Global apps cover Harare and Bulawayo at best, and the AI summaries they generate read like they were written for someone in London.\nI built mukoko weather to fix this. A few things that shaped the approach:\nWeather as a public good. The platform is free, no ads, no paywalls. If a smallholder farmer in Chinhoyi needs frost risk data to protect their crops tonight, that can’t be behind a subscription.\nHyperlocal context matters more than raw data. Zimbabwe has distinct agricultural seasons — Zhizha (rainy), Chirimo (spring), Masika (early rains), Munakamwe (winter). Elevation varies dramatically: the Highveld sits above 1,200m, the Zambezi Valley below 500m. The AI assistant, Shamwari Weather, is prompted with this geographic and seasonal context so its advice is actually meaningful to the user.\nConstrained environments are the primary target, not an edge case. Mobile-first, bandwidth-efficient, PWA-installable. The majority of users are on Android, often on 3G or spotty LTE. That’s not a future concern — it’s the baseline.\nTechnical decisions:\n ∙ Next.js 15 App Router on Cloudflare Pages + Workers\n ∙ AI summaries via Anthropic Claude SDK, server-side only, cached at the edge with KV and immutable TTL tiers (AI-generated weather advice shouldn’t change retroactively)\n ∙ Open-Meteo for forecast data (free, high-quality global model coverage)\n ∙ 90+ Zimbabwe locations validated against geographic bounds with elevation data for frost modelling\nThe broader vision is weather as infrastructure within a larger Africa super app (Mukoko Africa), with Zimbabwe as the proof of concept before expanding to other developing country markets using the same locally-grounded approach.\nWould love feedback on the approach, especially from anyone who’s built for similar markets — low-bandwidth, mobile-dominant, regions underserved by global platforms.
