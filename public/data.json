      "summary": "*golutra — One Person. One AI Squad.* webs:https://github.com/golutra/golutra\ngolutra is a next-generation multi-agent workspace that transforms your existing CLI tools into a unified AI collaboration hub. No project migration. No command relearning. No terminal switching. Just parallel execution, automated orchestration, and real-time result tracking. Click agent avatars to inspect logs, inject prompts directly into terminal streams, or monitor execution while your AI team runs silently in the background. Built with Vue 3 + Rust as a Tauri desktop app for Windows and macOS, golutra upgrades “one person + one editor” into *“one person + an AI squad.”* It replaces single-threaded, manual context switching with coordinated, multi-agent automation. *Key Highlights* * Unlimited multi-agent parallel execution\n* Automated orchestration from analysis to deployment\n* CLI compatibility: Claude, Gemini, Codex, OpenCode, Qwen\n* Stealth terminal with context-aware intelligence\n* Visual interface combined with command-line power Keep your familiar commands. golutra wires them into a complete engineering loop. --- ## What’s Next golutra is only at its beginning. The next evolution introduces a refactored *OpenClaw* as a true commander layer — a central AI coordinator capable of automatically creating agents, assigning roles, and generating structured collaboration channels based on task complexity. Instead of manually organizing workflows, golutra will dynamically assemble self-structured AI teams on demand. Upcoming capabilities include: * *Mobile Remote Control* — monitor agents, review logs, intervene, and redirect tasks directly from your phone.\n* *Auto Agent Builder* — quickly generate specialized agents for specific industries or scenarios (e.g., refactoring, compliance audits, trading systems, DevOps automation).\n* *Unified Agent Interface* — a standardized agent protocol for seamless integration into the orchestration layer.\n* *Deep Memory Layer* — persistent, shared long-horizon memory across agents to strengthen knowledge accumulation and cross-task reasoning. The mission is clear:\nevolve from multi-agent execution to *self-organizing AI teams*, improving overall collaboration efficiency by 30% or more through better coordination, specialization, and memory. One person. One AI squad.\nSoon — one intelligent AI organization. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47162675 Points: 1 # Comments: 1",
