      "summary": "I've developed a simple AI-powered video-to-text converter.\nUpload your video, and within minutes, its content will be converted into clear, searchable text. Our AI accurately captures spoken language, identifies different speakers and accents, reviews the generated transcript, and exports it in your preferred format—including TXT, DOCX, PDF, SRT, or VTT. You can then edit it, use it for subtitles, or share it anywhere.\nEverything runs directly in your browser. I'm primarily interested in feedback on output quality, user experience, and any technical improvements worth exploring.

      "summary": "I'm seeing individual programmers who have moved to 100% AI coding, but I'm curious as to how this is playing out for larger engineering teams. If you're on a team (let's say 5+ engineers) that has adopted Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or some other agent, can you share how it's going? Are you seeing more LOCs created? Has PR velocity or PR complexity changed? Do you find yourself spending the same amount of time on PRs, less, or more?
