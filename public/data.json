      "title": "Show HN: I DON'T want to upload my private files to AI",
      "summary": "Hi HN, For the past few years, I've been obsessed with a problem: my hard drive is a treasure chest of knowledge (PDFs, docs, notes) from the last decade, and I want to use modern AI to actually use it. But every solution forces a trade-off: either convenience (upload everything to the cloud) or privacy (let my files sit dormant locally). I got tired of this \"hold your nose\" compromise. With capable SLMs (Small Language Models) exploding and on-device compute (Apple Silicon, NPUs) finally catching up, I believe privacy and intelligence is no longer a false choice. So I (and my team) built KnowledgeFocus (Apple Silicon chips only) It's an open-source (Apache-2.0) knowledge engine built with Tauri (Rust + Python + TS), and it's 100% local-first. In v0.6.4, it focuses on one thing: unlocking your local file 'treasure chest'. - Scans & Indexes: It scans your designated local folders (PDFs, .md, .txt, .docx, etc.). - Auto-tagging: Uses a local model to auto-tag files, so you can aggregate and discover them. - Local RAG: You can 'chat' with all your local files. It runs RAG 100% on-device. No data (vectors included) ever leaves your machine. Website (Download): https://github.com/huozhong-in/knowledge-focus This is just the first step of our \"Data Workbench\" vision. I have a lot more thoughts on 'local-first agents', 'data aggregation' (like pulling in your cloud AI chat logs to store them locally), and building a real 'second brain' for knowledge workers. I'll be in the comments to expand on these ideas and our future roadmap. I'm here for all the feedback—especially the critical kind. Thanks, HN.

      "summary": "Here's my embarrassing story: I thought \"gaming highlights\" would work. Made 20 videos. Got 47 subscribers. Realized the CPM is like $2-4. Would need 500K views just to make $1K/month. Not happening. Then I tried \"motivational quotes\". Saturated. Couldn't get any traction. Then \"meditation music\". Also saturated. Plus copyright issues. I was so frustrated. I knew faceless channels could work (I saw some making money), but I had no idea HOW to find profitable ones. Manually searching YouTube was a nightmare: - Most channels show face sometimes (not truly faceless) - Can't tell if they're actually monetized - No way to know their revenue - Takes forever to find good examples I wasted 3 months guessing. Made 50+ videos across different niches. Got nowhere. Then I realized the problem: I was trying to find profitable faceless channels manually. It's impossible. There are millions of channels. How do you know which ones are actually making money? So I built a scraper to track faceless channels making $5K+/month. Started analyzing what actually works. What I found: - Personal finance reviews (budget products) - Channels making $15K-35K/mo - Tech comparisons (budget tech angle) - Channels making $12K-28K/mo - \"How it works\" explained content - Channels making $8K-20K/mo - Ranking videos (\"Top 10 X under $Y\") - Channels making $6K-18K/mo - Historical deep dives - Channels making $10K-22K/mo The pattern: All successful faceless channels pick a micro-niche. Not \"tech reviews\" but \"budget gaming laptops under $800\". I turned my research into a tool called *ApexVix* so other people don't waste months like I did. It tracks profitable faceless channels across all niches and shows you: - Real channels making $5K-30K/month - What niches they're in - Growth patterns - Upload frequency that works It's free to use: apexvix No signup needed. I just wish I had this when I started. Would've saved me 3 months of guessing. If you're struggling to find profitable faceless niches, this might help. Happy to answer questions!

I feel like this is a great use of AI where it’s not really thinking just converting from one language to another.   Thoughts?
