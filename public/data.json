      "summary": "We built Sentient to automatically extract themes and sentiment from customer feedback without manual configuration. The system processes documents in sub-second time while maintaining 95% accuracy. Built with Next.js 14 and FastAPI, using fine-tuned OpenAI models trained on millions of feedback examples. Key features include automatic customer segmentation, multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, CSV), and real-time processing. The core insight: most tools analyze individual reviews instead of understanding customer journeys and behavioral patterns. Sentient connects feedback sentiment to business outcomes through multi-phase AI analysis. Technical approach uses theme detection, emotion recognition, and intelligent caching for enterprise-grade performance.

      "summary": "Hi HN ,\nI’m Vivek Jaiswal, Founder & Technology Strategist at QBits Marketing Research. We built TruthGuard, an AI-powered validation platform designed to detect synthetic, low-quality, or fraudulent survey responses in large-scale research datasets — a $10B+ issue in global data collection. TruthGuard runs a multi-stage validation pipeline combining: LLM-based semantic verification (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure models) Vector similarity scoring using Qdrant/Chroma Anomaly & pattern detection for response duplication Adaptive thresholding tuned with live dataset feedback It processes 100K+ responses per day with 99%+ accuracy, cutting operational costs by over 60% for our enterprise clients. I’d love to get feedback from this community — especially around: Improving real-time validation at scale Better approaches for prompt consistency between multiple LLMs Efficient ways to benchmark accuracy on mixed human + AI datasets Code architecture and system design overview (non-confidential parts) are here:\n github.com/vivekjaiswal-ai/truthguard Thanks for reading — open to ideas, critiques, and collaborations! — Vivek Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767359 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

Write one master instruction file with Agent Smith, then export it directly to your project root for your Gemini, Claude, and Codex AI coding assistants to read. Agent Smith lets developers create unified configuration files for all their AI coding tools. Instead of maintaining multiple prompt templates or setup notes, you define a single “Master Instruction” file per project that standardizes your coding environment across assistants.
