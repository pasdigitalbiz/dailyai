      "summary": "Hi HN, I built an assumption-driven AI security assessment for teams shipping AI features without a dedicated security team yet. You paste your AI use case (what it does, data types, vendors, deployment). In ~10 minutes you get a PDF report by email containing:\n- Trust boundaries + data flows + a threat model diagram (explicitly marked as conceptual/assumption-based)\n- Threats mapped to STRIDE + MAESTRO (agentic AI)\n- A risk rating (impact/likelihood) + 5×5 risk matrix\n- Recommended security controls and compliance mappings (example: EU AI Act, NIST AI 600-1) Important: we make assumptions (ex: AWS deployment, common patterns) and we call them out in the report so you can correct them. Link: https://raxit.ai/assessment Would love feedback on what’s wrong, what’s missing, and what would make this actually useful in a real security review.

      "summary": "Hey HN! we built Structurify ( https://structurify.ai ) to solve a problem we kept hitting at our AI consultancy: enterprises drowning in unstructured documents that need to become structured data.\nThe typical approach is OCR + custom ML pipelines, which takes months to build and degrades on anything that isn't a clean PDF. We took a different approach — contextual AI understanding instead of character-level OCR.\nWhat it does: Upload any document (PDF, scan, photo, Word, Excel, PowerPoint) → describe what you want extracted in plain English → get structured JSON/CSV in ~30 seconds. 93%+ accuracy.\nWe have 169 pre-built extraction templates (SDS, invoices, medical records, W-9s, construction pay apps, etc.) but you can also describe custom extractions without any template.\nSome things we're proud of: Multi-page understanding (connects data across 50+ page documents)\nMulti-language (30+ languages)\nConfidence scoring with human-in-the-loop review\nFull REST API, webhook support, most integrations done in a day\n$0.20/extraction, no subscription, credits never expire Curious what HN thinks. Happy to answer technical questions about the architecture.\nFree trial: 50 credits with work email, no CC required.
