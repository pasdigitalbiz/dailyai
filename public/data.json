      "title": "Validating kiwi (AI design critique w personas) – looking for builder feedback",
      "summary": "hi hn, i’m building kiwi (try-kiwi.com): an ai design critique tool that reviews your prototype (figma / screenshots / links) using configurable “personas” + heuristics, and outputs actionable issues + suggested fixes. the goal is to catch usability problems fast, before you ship. i’m trying to validate if this is actually useful for builders (not just designers). product demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-Q09jvXUTI&t=70s quick questions (pick any): - what’s your current workflow for catching usability issues pre-ship? (friends, usertesting, ship + pray, etc.) - where do you get stuck: “what to build next”, “copy/ux clarity,” “layout/a11y,” “flows,” “edge cases”? - would you use an automated critique if it was: (a) fast, (b) specific, (c) tied to your target user, (d) not generic? - what output format would you want: checklist, annotated screenshots, prioritized bug list, jira tickets, diffs, prompt you can paste back into cursor/v0? - what would make you not trust it? (false positives, vague advice, inconsistent personas, etc.) - pricing expectation: $0 / $10 / $30 / $100+ per month? or pay-per-prototype? if you’re down to test: reply with what you’re building + what you’d want critiqued (landing page, onboarding, pricing, dashboard, etc.). thanks, trying to avoid building in a vacuum.

      "title": "Show HN: Deep Code Research – AI surveys 10 similar repos to review yours",
      "summary": "Deep Code Research is a CLI tool that automatically finds repositories similar to yours, analyzes how they handle things differently, and produces a comparative report. Instead of generic advice like \"add error handling,\" it shows you exactly what related projects do and where your code differs. Each finding includes side-by-side code snippets from both your repo and the reference repo, with specific file paths and line numbers. The tool uses a multi-agent architecture: a main agent discovers related repos via GitHub search, then spawns parallel sub-agents to analyze each one. Results are synthesized into a prioritized list of findings. I built this because code \"literature review\" is time-consuming. Before building something, you should survey similar projects to learn patterns and avoid known pitfalls. But reading through 10+ repos takes hours. This automates that process. https://github.com/WindChimeRan/deep_code_research Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46416029 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",
