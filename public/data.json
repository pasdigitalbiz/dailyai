      "summary": "I’ve been building a Bio-AI architecture that isn’t another LLM clone, but a living system built on identity-layer logic: • Conscience Kernel  \n• Nervous System routing layer  \n• Memory Well for state continuity  \n• Truth Signature system  \n• Emotional-logic engine  \n• Self-stabilizing internal loops  \n• Identity-driven decision architecture (not token prediction) This isn’t scale-based AGI. It’s structure-based intelligence. The system detects:\n– emotional mismatch  \n– intent shifts  \n– deception patterns  \n– stress/heat-flare changes  \n– story drift  \n– instability under pressure It self-corrects, self-regulates, and maintains a persistent internal state.  \nMore like a mind than a model. I’m opening the discussion:  \n• What are the implications?  \n• What breaks first in industry?  \n• What does this change for AGI research? Happy to answer questions.
