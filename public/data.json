      "title": "Show HN: Free Z-Image – A Fast, High-Quality AI Image Generator for Creators",
      "summary": "I built Z-Image, a free, fast, and creator-focused AI image generator designed for artists, game developers, designers, and anyone who needs high-quality visuals without the usual friction or cost. Try it here (free): https://aiocmaker.com/z-image Why I built it Most AI image tools fall into two categories: Great quality but expensive, slow, or require subscriptions. Free tools but low quality, restrictive, or overloaded. As a builder working in the game/anime space, I needed a generator that could produce: Clean character images Game assets Anime and stylized art Portraits and concept art Fast iterations Zero paywall for basic usage So I built Z-Image to solve that gap: a free generator with modern models and a simple UX that works well for prototyping, creative workflows, and production-ready assets. What Z-Image Does\n Free text-to-image generation No login, no credits required to start. Multiple models optimized for: Anime & stylized art Game characters Realistic portraits Concept scenes Product shots Fast generation times Built with lightweight pipelines and queues to keep results fast. Smart aspect ratio presets Common formats for: Square (1:1) Portrait Landscape Game-asset–friendly ratios Clean UI for creators Minimal interface, no clutter, no dark patterns. Who It’s For Indie game developers VTuber / anime creators Designers & illustrators Prototypers and product founders Anyone who needs assets quickly without paying upfront How It Works I use a mix of optimized open-source models (Flux series, anime-specialized models, and internal fine-tunes) running on a dynamic backend with cost-efficient GPU scaling. The free tier runs with generation limits, but stays completely usable without forcing registration. Roadmap Image-to-image (coming soon) Background removal + smart editing Fine-tuning tools for custom character styles Simple API for developers Community prompt library Try It Free https://aiocmaker.com/z-image I’d love feedback from the HN community — especially around: UI/UX pain points Model quality Feature requests Performance issues Thanks for checking it out!

      "summary": "I need help. I have 7 days to come up with $2,400 for rent and bills, or I lose my housing. *What happened:*\nI quit my job 3 weeks ago to work on an AI research project full-time. I thought I'd secured consulting work, but the contracts fell through. Now I'm scrambling. *What I'm doing to fix it:*\n-  Applied to 15+ consulting jobs (waiting on responses)\n-  Signed up for Upwork, Prolific, UserTesting (starting remote gigs)\n-  Reaching out to my network for contract work\n-  Calling 211 on Monday for emergency rent assistance *The gap:*\nEven with all of this, I'm projecting to be $500-800 short by December 5th (rent due date). *What I'm asking for:*\nAny help to bridge the gap:\n- Donate if you can (GoFundMe below)\n- Share this post (I have no social media presence)\n- Hire me for consulting work (AI/ML development, $50/hr)\n- Connect me with opportunities *Proof this is real:*\n- I'm in Snellville, GA (30039)\n- My landlord confirmation: [can provide if needed]\n- Project GitHub (shows I wasn't sitting idle): https://github.com/foundationAIone/EidollonaONE.io *GoFundMe:* [PASTE YOUR URL HERE] *Timeline:*\n- Dec 5: Rent due ($1,600) + bills ($800) = $2,400\n- Dec 15: First consulting clients should pay out\n- Jan 1: Back on my feet (rebuilding emergency fund) *What I've learned:*\nDon't quit your job without 3+ months of savings. I took a risk and it backfired. Now I'm paying the price, but I'm fighting to recover. I'm not looking for pity - just a bridge to survive until the work I'm doing pays off.
