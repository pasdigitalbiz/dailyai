      "title": "Show HN: I built an AI that scans 10k Reddit comments to find 'Blue Ocean' ideas",
      "summary": "Hi HN,\nI dropped out of college 3 months ago to solve my own problem: I kept building SaaS products that nobody wanted.\nI realized I was guessing instead of measuring. So I built a system to automate \"Market Signal Detection\" using LLMs.\nThe Architecture:\n1. Ingests data primarily from Reddit (niche communities), Hacker News, and rising Search Queries.\n2. Filters for \"Negative Sentiment\" + \"Financial Pain\" (e.g., people complaining about losing money).\n3. Calculates a \"Velocity Score\" to spot trends before they hit mainstream Google Trends.\nI wrote a detailed technical breakdown of the methodology and the \"3 Signals\" I look for (Bleeding Neck, Fragmentation, Wallet Index).\nYou can read the full guide (no paywall) here: https://blog.vect.pro/trend-hacking-guide The tool itself is part of the platform I'm building, but the guide stands alone as a framework for finding ideas manually if you prefer.\nWould love feedback on the signal detection logic.\n- Afraz Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46261174 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Show HN: Hazbin Hotel OC Maker – Create Original Characters with AI",
      "summary": "Hi HN I built a Hazbin Hotel OC Maker, an AI-powered tool that helps fans create original characters (OCs) inspired by the Hazbin Hotel universe. As a fan myself, I noticed that many creators struggle to turn vague ideas into a complete OC — especially when it comes to personality, backstory, visual traits, and tone consistency with the Hazbin Hotel style. Most tools focus only on images or only on text, so I wanted to combine both into a single workflow. What it does Generates original Hazbin Hotel–style characters (not existing canon characters) Helps define: Name & demon type Personality traits Backstory & motivations Visual description suitable for artists or AI image tools Designed for writers, roleplayers, and artists Works entirely in the browser, no setup required Why I made it I’m building a broader AI OC creation platform, and this is one of the first focused generators aimed at a specific fandom. Hazbin Hotel has a very distinct tone and aesthetic, which made it an interesting challenge for prompt design and style control. Link Hazbin Hotel OC Maker https://aiocmaker.com/oc-maker/hazbin-hotel-oc-maker Notes This is a fan-made tool and is not affiliated with Vivienne Medrano or A24 Feedback is very welcome — especially from writers and artists who create OCs regularly Happy to answer any questions about the tech, prompts, or design decisions.
