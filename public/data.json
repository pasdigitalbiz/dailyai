      "title": "Show HN: DepositGenie – stop unfair deductions with photos and AI reports",
      "summary": "Hey everyone! I’m a solo founder building a tool I wish I’d had years ago. If you’ve ever rented a place, you’ve probably worried about your security deposit. You take move-in photos, cross your fingers at move-out, and hope the landlord doesn’t decide the scuff on the wall is “$400 worth of damage.” I’ve been there..and it sucks. That’s why I built DepositGenie: Deposit Armor — an iOS app that helps renters actually keep their deposits by making documentation dead simple. What it does:\n- Organize your move-in and move-out photos by room, with timestamps and notes. - AI highlights possible deductions, like comparing before/after shots and flagging what looks new or changed. - Export everything into a clean, court-ready report if you need to dispute charges. - Track key deadlines so you don’t miss refund windows or inspection dates. Basically, it’s a pocket-sized armor kit for renters. Why now: More people are renting than ever, and most of us don’t know what to do when deductions happen. You don’t need a lawyer, you just need organized proof. DepositGenie gives you that. Tech & business side: I built it with Flutter + Firebase, designed everything myself, and launched it on a shoestring. The app is free to try with optional in-app upgrades for full features. I’m not a big company, just one person trying to fix a tiny but expensive pain point. Looking for feedback: I’d love your honest thoughts on:\n- Whether this scratches a real itch you’ve had\n- What would make it more useful\n- How you’d price something like this\n- Any pitfalls I’m not seeing (legal, UX, trust, etc.) Even better if you’ve had your own “deposit nightmare” stories, those inspired half the feature set. Thanks for reading, and if you check it out, I’d really appreciate any feedback or critique. — Zach\nFounder @ Dreamsmith LLC Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45787850 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

I went searching for some AI-related discussion in that subreddit and it’s strongly negative. Additionally, Reddit-wide the sentiment appears to be very negative. Is there some kind of phenomenon that results in communities like Reddit being unreceptive to AI whereas places like hacker news are more receptive (or at least open)?
