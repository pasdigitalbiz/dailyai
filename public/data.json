Any guidance on where to begin or which areas to focus on would be greatly appreciated. While I prefer online courses, I’m also open to other learning formats like books, YouTube channels, or tutorials. Thanks in advance for your advice!

      "title": "Show HN: Story Keeper – AI agents with narrative continuity instead of memory",
      "summary": "Hi HN! Creator here.\nI built Story Keeper to solve a problem I kept hitting with AI agents: they remember everything but lose coherence over long conversations.\nThe Core Idea\nInstead of storing chat history and retrieving chunks (RAG approach), Story Keeper maintains a living narrative: Characters: Who you are (evolving), who the agent is\nArc: Where you started → where you're going\nThemes: What matters to you\nContext: The thread connecting everything Think of it as the difference between reading meeting notes vs. being in the relationship.\nTechnical Approach\n~200 lines of Python. Three primitives: Story State (not message list)\nStory Evolution (not appending)\nStory-Grounded Response (not retrieval) Works with any LLM - tested with GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3.1, Mistral.\nWhy This Works\nTraditional memory is about facts. Story Keeper is about continuity.\nExample: Health coaching agent Normal: Generic advice each time\nStory Keeper: \"This is the pattern we identified last month. You do better with 'good enough' than perfect.\" The agent carries forward understanding, not just data.\nImplementation\nPart of PACT-AX (open source agent collaboration framework). MIT licensed.\nSimple integration:\npythonfrom pact_ax.primitives.story_keeper import StoryKeeper keeper = StoryKeeper(agent_id=\"my-agent\")\nresponse = keeper.process_turn(user_message)\nUse Cases I'm Exploring Long-term coaching/mentorship\nMulti-session research assistants\nCustomer support with relationship continuity\nEducational tutors that understand learning journeys What I'd Love Feedback On Is this solving a real problem or am I overthinking it?\nPerformance concerns at scale?\nOther approaches people have tried for this?\nUse cases I'm missing? The full technical writeup is in the repo blog folder.\nHappy to answer questions! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45685363 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",
