      "title": "Show HN: Zootopia OC Maker – Create Zootopia-Style Original Characters with AI",
      "summary": "Hi HN, I built Zootopia OC Maker, a small AI tool for creating original characters inspired by Disney’s Zootopia. The idea came from seeing how many fans enjoy world-building, fan fiction, role-playing, and concept art around Zootopia, but don’t necessarily have drawing skills. This tool lets you describe a character (species, job, personality, district, vibe), and it generates a Zootopia-style OC that visually fits into the universe. Link: https://aiocmaker.com/oc-maker/zootopia-oc-maker What it does Generate Zootopia-style animal OCs (police officers, civilians, performers, hackers, reporters, etc.) Supports a wide range of species and city roles Visual style inspired by Zootopia 1 & 2, but characters are fully original Useful for fan fiction, comics, roleplay, storyboarding, or just creative fun Why I built it Most AI image tools are very general. I wanted to experiment with a theme-focused OC maker that understands a specific universe’s tone, proportions, and personality style, while still encouraging original characters rather than copying existing ones. Tech notes Prompt-driven image generation with style constraints Focus on expressive faces, body proportions, and cinematic lighting No copyrighted character replication (OC-only by design) This is still early and very much an experiment. I’d love feedback from HN on: UX / prompt flow How useful this is for creative work Ideas for other themed OC makers Happy to answer questions or share more details. Thanks for checking it out! — Builder of Zootopia OC Maker Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46252454 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Show HN: OAuth-style authorization for AI agents",
      "summary": "What would you want to control about AI agents in your life? Would you let an AI agent send emails on your behalf? Most people say \"no\" - too risky. But what if you could set rules like:\n• \"Only send to people in my contacts\"\n• \"Never spend over $50\"\n• \"Only book meetings between 2-4pm\"\n• \"Block domains: competitor.com\" That's what I built. Introducing PIA (Personal Identity Agent) - an authorization platform for AI agents. It's like IAM for your life:\n- Define policies (what agents can/can't do)\n- Agents authenticate via OAuth flow\n- LLM verifies every action against your rules\n- Full audit trail Built an SDK and 5 production agents to prove it:\n Email •  Calendar •  Contacts •  Files •  Tasks All live. All production-ready.\nAll at: digital-embodiments.vercel.app The SDK is on NPM:\nnpm install @variant96/pia-sdk Tech: Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, NextAuth, Groq/Gemini This is my bet on how we'll safely delegate to AI agents. Thoughts? What would make this more useful? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46251929 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",

      "summary": "After many years of working hard, my wife and I finally decided to have a kid recently. I am looking forward to spending a lot more time with her, while working just a 9-5. However, the AI boom seems like a short-lived, once in a life-time opportunity. Now I am considering if I should dive in fully even if it means sacrificing time with family? Options:\n1) Joining an AI startup \n2) Founding an AI startup \n3) Stay at my big-tech role I make good money at my current role, but I am extremely passionate about the work I do. With the AI boom, there seems to be a lot of great infra, data movement and algorithmic challenges on the table. However, it is also clear that options 1 and 2 seem to require a lot more time commitment than a simple 9-5 job. There are also financial considerations. If AI affects the SWE job market in a meaningful way, my future salary will be drastically low. Maybe it makes sense to devote myself to work for 3-5 more years and make a lot more money in the short term? I understand that there is also some probability associated with the final amount I walk away with. Any others thinking about how to approach the AI boom vs leaning in fully to parenthood?
