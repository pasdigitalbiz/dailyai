      "summary": "Hi HN, we’ve been working on Seedream 4.5, a next-generation image model focused on high consistency, realistic detail, and multi-image creative control. It’s designed for creators who need stable characters, clean structure, and production-grade visuals — not just lucky one-off generations. Key features: Multi-Image Consistency: Maintain the same face, style, lighting, and scene logic across batches or sequential renders. High-Fidelity Rendering: Improved materials, shadows, anatomy handling, and fine-detail realism. Flexible Workflows: Supports text-to-image, reference-to-image, multi-reference fusion, style transfer, layout-aware generation, and high-res outputs. Creator-Ready Editing: Modify backgrounds, clothing, mood, and composition while preserving identity and structure. Fast Iteration: Generate multiple variations, refine style, or re-render consistent character sets in seconds. Why we built this: Seedream 4.5 aims to make coherent, editable, production-oriented image generation accessible to artists, designers, marketers, and anyone building multi-shot or multi-style visual workflows. We’d love feedback on: How you’d use high-consistency image models in your projects. What tools or APIs would make Seedream easier to integrate.
