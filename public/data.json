      "summary": "All the examples of non-breaking spaces that they showed were arguably places where someone nicely typesetting might well do the same thing. For example, in \"FY 2025\", or \"$8.7 billion\". (I've even done this a lot myself in the past.)\nI wouldn't call this a watermark, but more a sign of likely copy&paste, if students' word processors weren't currently doing that. A \"watermark\" that invisibly identifies the text origin using Unicode tricks sounds possible. And maybe you could do some things with statistical patterns. Or you could, as some have done in the past, is to stego the identifying information in a way that's hard to spot but can't be denied later (e.g., the first letter of each word clearly spells out \"john smith is a cheater who copied this from chatgpt\").

      "summary": "I built EIDOS because I wanted a faster and more flexible way to prototype game ideas without repeatedly writing the same boilerplate code. EIDOS is an AI-powered IDE that can:\n• Generate gameplay code from natural language descriptions  \n• Edit existing code through an integrated AI assistant  \n• Open the correct editor automatically (text editor, code editor, or video editor) depending on the file  \n• Run prototypes instantly for quick iteration As a solo developer, I spent years building my own tools to speed up experimentation. This project is the result of trying to remove the setup time, folder structures, and repetitive coding that often slow down early-stage game development. I’d appreciate any feedback on usability, performance, or what features would be most helpful for indie developers or small teams.
