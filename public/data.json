      "title": "Show HN: I made an AI tool that applies to jobs via cold email",
      "summary": "I made an AI tool that applies to jobs via cold email because LinkedIn Easy Apply was getting me nowhere. Most applications just disappear into ATS filters, so I wanted something that sends a personalised application directly to the company or HR. The tool extracts information from your resume, matches it with the job description, writes a personalised email in your style, and either finds the company email automatically or lets you set your own. It then sends the email with your CV attached through your own personal email account. There are two modes:\nRapid Mode uses LinkedIn search results, and CSV Mode lets you upload a list of jobs and apply to all of them in one go. I originally built it for myself, but decided to share it in case it helps anyone else dealing with the same frustrations. Happy to answer questions or get feedback from the community.

      "summary": "I've noticed that when using various AI tools, there's often a short pause—sometimes a few seconds, sometimes longer, especially AI coding case—before the model returns an answer. It's an awkward amount of time: too short to switch tasks, but long enough to break your flow. I'm curious: - What do you typically do while waiting for an AI response?\n(Do you zone out? Check email? Scroll HN? Or not think about it at all?) - What would you like to be able to do during that time?\n(Quick actions? Useful hints? Better progress indicators? Something else?) - Have you seen any products that handle this waiting experience particularly well—or poorly? Thanks!
