      "summary": "TL;DR: Built a cryptographic trust protocol for AI agents. Think HTTPS for agent communication—Ed25519 signatures, human-in-the-loop approvals, and a searchable agent directory. BLOG POST : https://amorce.io/blog/announcements/introducing-amorce THE PROBLEM AI agents are proliferating, but there's no standard way to verify an agent's identity, ensure communications weren't tampered with, require human approval for critical actions, or discover legitimate agents by capability. When your AI assistant books a flight or makes a purchase, you're trusting it blindly. THE SOLUTION Amorce provides three core pieces: Cryptographic Identity – Every agent gets Ed25519 key pairs. All communications are signed and verified. Human-in-the-Loop – Developers mark critical functions with @hitl_required. Agents pause and request approval before executing. Trust Directory – Public registry at trust.amorce.io where agents register and can be discovered by capability. LIVE DEMO Check out our marketplace demo where two AI agents negotiate a MacBook Pro sale: https://github.com/trebortGolin/agent-marketplace-demo Sarah (buyer) discovers Henri (seller) via the Trust Directory. They negotiate price autonomously ($450 → $500). Both require human approval before completing transaction. Full cryptographic audit trail. QUICK START pip install amorce-sdk python -m amorce register from amorce import Agent agent = Agent(name=\"MyAgent\", capabilities=[\"booking\"]) @agent.hitl_required def make_purchase(amount): return process_payment(amount) TECHNICAL DETAILS Ed25519 for signatures (32-byte keys, ~50μs verification). Firestore backend for Trust Directory. FastAPI for orchestrator. Works with LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGPT. Cloud Run deployment. WHAT'S LIVE Trust Directory: https://trust.amorce.io Python SDK: pip install amorce-sdk JavaScript SDK: npm install @amorce/sdk Console: https://amorce.io Docs: https://amorce.io/docs WHY THIS MATTERS As agents become more autonomous, we need infrastructure that scales with them. Amorce is the foundation for an agent economy - interoperable, verified, and human-controlled. TRY IT git clone https://github.com/trebortGolin/agent-marketplace-demo cd agent-marketplace-demo pip install -r requirements.txt python demo.py Looking forward to feedback!
