      "title": "Ask HN: How do teams handle dynamic tool discovery for AI agents?",
      "summary": "In traditional service architectures, DNS / service mesh\nworks — but in AI agent platforms where tools may be\nadded/removed and clients need capability-based discovery,\nthis pattern feels insufficient. What approaches have companies used for dynamic\ncapability discovery (not just network location) for LLM\nagent workloads? Would love to hear successful patterns\nor stumbling blocks from real implementations. Context: I've built a minimal MCP control plane / registry prototype for enterprise\ndiscovery, but curious about patterns in practice.

      "title": "Show HN: Omelo- AI pet health companion, Health timelines and Daily care",
      "summary": "Hey HN, I’m Amogh. I’m a solo founder building Omelo. Pet parents make health decisions with almost no data: missed vaccines, forgotten deworming, vague symptoms, scattered notes. Most advice comes from Google or WhatsApp groups. Omelo is a mobile app that combines: 1. A health timeline built from walks, meals, grooming, vaccines, and expenses 2. A vet-trained AI companion (trained on veterinary literature) that answers questions in context of your pet’s history 3. Support for multiple pets, so patterns show up over time instead of being lost in chat logs The idea is simple: turn everyday pet care into structured data, then use AI to reason over that data before something becomes an emergency. We started on WhatsApp, served ~5,000+ pet parents, ran ~80k conversations, and just launched the mobile app to make timelines, reminders, and tracking possible. Tech stack is intentionally boring. The hard part wasn’t models, it was designing trust, tone, and longitudinal context. Would love feedback on: - How you’d design health timelines for non-verbal users - Where AI actually helps vs where it becomes noise - What you’d strip out if this feels too heavy App link: https://www.beomelo.com Happy to answer anything—product, tech, mistakes, or what didn’t work.

These are just two random examples that occurred to me (likely out of some sci-fi dystopian novella floating in the aether that i picked up on). But what do you think the bad news is gonna be 1 year from now? What is the worst they are going to be discovered doing? Or will it be all good? Let's hope so!
