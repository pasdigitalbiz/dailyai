      "title": "Any reliable free AI business plan generators?",
      "summary": "I’m in the early planning stage of a new project and looking for tools that can help me structure a rough but reliable business plan. I’m not ready to pay for software yet, so I’m curious if anyone here has used a free AI business plan generator that was actually helpful.\nIf you’ve used any free tools that gave decent, detailed output, what was your experience like?\nNot looking for promotions just honest feedback from people who’ve actually tried them.\nThanks!

      "title": "Why Some AI SaaS Ideas Reach $100M",
      "summary": "When people think about AI startup ideas, they usually imagine something novel, technical, or impressive on a demo. But when you look at AI SaaS companies that quietly reach meaningful scale, the pattern is much less exciting — and much more repeatable. They don’t invent new behaviour. They replace old, manual workflows that people already complain about. Reporting. Ops. Support. Compliance. Sales admin. Boring work that happens every day and costs real money. AI changes the economics. Tasks that once required teams, process, and time can now be handled by small systems built by very few people. That’s where many of the real opportunities live, not in “breakthrough intelligence,” but in obvious pain that finally became cheap enough to solve. What surprised me while researching this was how often the same problems showed up across different communities and industries. Different words, same frustration.\nThat research eventually turned into startupideasdb,com a way to spot AI-friendly SaaS opportunities grounded in repeated, public pain rather than trend-driven ideas. Curious how others here approach this.\nWhen you think about AI SaaS, do you start with the tech, or with the most boring problem you can find?
