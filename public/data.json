      "summary": "Hi HN, I built a small tool to solve a recurring pain when editing podcasts: scrubbing back and forth just to find where a sentence or idea actually ends. How it works: - Upload an audio file (MP3/WAV/M4A) - AI transcribes the audio and suggests cut points at sentence or paragraph boundaries - Automatically split and export segments, or adjust them manually if needed Website: https://transcribeandsplit.com/ This came out of my own frustration with editing long recordings and manually hunting for the right cut points. I wanted something that actually understands the content before splitting it. I’d love feedback — especially on edge cases like interviews, lectures, or multi-speaker audio.

      "title": "Binary Prediction and Artificial Intelligence = Automation for Businesses",
      "summary": "Hi! I recently came across the thought while building and Artificial Intelligence Operating System to automate Business & Employees that I believe businesses at any scale should be using binary Prediction systems in there software. We are seeing a huge scale in these systems right now as Polymarket and Kashi are growing at a very exponential rate. If you are unfamiliar with the methods of these Binary prediction systems let me explain. Polymarket uses as on a scale from 0 to 1, so 0-0.5-1, 0=false or no, 1=true or Yes. See each \"Question\" In polymarket starts at .5 or .50 or 50% right in the middle of 0 and 1 and when you vote and give your money to them for say I vote yes it sways that value to say 65% or .65 depending on the volume of voting and swaying obviously. Now i'm sure your asking why and how is it possible for these company's to integrate these systems or Bayesian Formula into there software and why does Artificial Intelligence matter. This system with the right amount of volume allows us like never before to guess the future to an extensive rate like we have never seen before, and its pretty accurate. Now image you are using Polymarket and you have the option for a person who has 10x the intelligence as you to replace you and place your inputs for you. Surely you would take this option right? It makes the most sense?! Right!? Right. I have taken Binary Prediction method and Combined it with an intelligent learning system. Users, Business Owners, Employees like you can join this application and connect your integrations like Gmail, Stripe, Shopify, Asana, Slack, Google Calendar and allow the environment to catch events from those integrations - for example A Shopify order comes in \"Order #1004\" as soon as it is caught the system checks other integrations connected and paves a route of the Event \"Order #1004\", When you the user click this Order it shows you the route like \"Fulfill Order\", \"Compose Email to User being thankful for order\", \"Update the Team in Slack about Order\", \"Create Calendar event to fulfill order later\", among various things. And in one button you can complete all the Actions per the Event and integrations. This Environment uses Binary Prediction to intelligently pre-fill these Actions off of the Event Context and it learns and adapts to you the longer you use it. My hope is in the future, this environment along with enough data can guess where and when future payments, orders, tasks, anything you can think of business wise, and work on them before they even arrive so you can focus on the things that matter. I hope you found this interesting-- I built this in my dorm room so check it out, Build Something Great- Zeke, https://harmonized-ai.com Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45923788 Points: 1 # Comments: 1",
