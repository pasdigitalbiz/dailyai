      "title": "Fractal Native – doesn't optimize your AI workflow",
      "summary": "Hello there, Problem: I wanted to reduce DX friction when using ai to verify that ai-implemented features perform exactly what the developer had in mind. And I'm stuck now... Context:\nFirst, I thought we could formalize prompts so that they become the code. The idea: a project spec where particular words define behavior, and changing the words changes the program. Each word is a function, so pressing \"Go To... (F12)\" drops you into a nested behavior (hence \"Fractal\"). So it would be a meta-spec language interpreted by an ai compiler while still using native language (hence \"Native\"). But this rests on a wrong assumption — that developers are open to learning a new language (less formalized than TS, Java, or Go, yet still formalized). I don't think that can happen anymore. The next coding language is purely English (or any other natural language). Second, I discussed the idea with a friend and we realized that tests are a nice descriptor of behaviors (with quite some exceptions ofc). Ideation continued, and long story short, here's the Language Spec: https://github.com/slowestmonkey/fractal/blob/main/README.md So why am I stuck? I've come to the realization that prompting ai and receiving correct behavior isn't enough for engineer. I can't confidently say \"it makes sense\" unless I understand how and why it was built that way. Here's the realization: https://www.conjectly.com/thoughts/7 And so I'm asking for help or advice on:\n- if and how this idea can go further\n- what other wrong assumptions I've made Please share your thoughts and thank you.
