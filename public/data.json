      "title": "Ask HN: Has anyone built payment flows inside AI voice calls?",
      "summary": "Hey HN, We originally were building vertical voice agents for fitness centers. During customer conversations, the idea of collecting payment during the call (via SMS link, keypad, or voice) would sometimes come up as something that might be useful. We’re trying to understand how people have approached this in practice. If you’ve worked on production voice systems or payments, I had a few questions:\n1) Have you implemented in-call payment flows?\n2) What tradeoffs or issues did you run into (compliance, reliability, etc.)?\n3) Was it something customers actually used, or mostly ignored? We also noticed a YC F24 company (Protegee) explored this space and later pivoted, which makes us curious what lessons people took away from that generation of attempts. Appreciate any real-world experience or pointers. We’re trying to learn from folks who’ve actually shipped this. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46584015 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Ask HN: How to automate aesthetic photo cropping? (CV/AI)",
      "summary": "Hi everyone, I am a backend developer currently engineering an in-house automation tool for a K-pop merchandise production company (photocards, postcards, etc.). I have built an MVP using Python (FastAPI) + Libvips + InsightFace to automate the process where designers previously had to manually crop thousands of high-resolution photos using Illustrator. While basic face detection and image quality preservation (CMYK conversion, etc.) are successful, I am hitting a bottleneck in automating the \"Designer's Sense (Vibe/Aesthetics).\" [Current Stack & Workflow] Tech Stack: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Libvips (Processing), InsightFace (Landmark Detection). Workflow: Bulk Upload $\\rightarrow$ Landmark Extraction (InsightFace) $\\rightarrow$ Auto-crop based on pre-defined ratios $\\rightarrow$ Human-in-the-loop fine-tuning via Web UI. [The Challenges] Mechanical Logic vs. Aesthetic Crop Simple centering logic fails to capture the \"perfect shot\" for K-pop idols who often have dynamic poses or varying camera angles. Issue: Even if the landmarks are mathematically centered, the resulting headroom is often inconsistent, or the chin is awkwardly cut off. The output lacks visual stability compared to a human designer's work. Need for Reference-Based One-Shot Style Transfer Clients often provide a single \"Guide Image\" and ask, \"Crop the rest of the 5,000 photos with this specific feel.\" (e.g., a tight face-filling close-up vs. a spacious upper-body shot). Goal: Instead of designers manually guessing the ratio, I want the AI to reverse-engineer the composition (face-to-canvas ratio, relative position) from that one sample image and apply it dynamically to the rest of the batch. [Questions] Q1. Direction for Improving Aesthetic Composition Is it more practical to refine Rule-based Heuristics (e.g., fixing eye position to the top 30% with complex conditionals), or should I look into \"Aesthetic Quality Assessment (AQA)\" or \"Saliency Detection\" models to score and select the best crop? As of 2026, what is the most efficient, production-ready approach for this? Q2. One-Shot Composition Transfer Are there any known algorithms or libraries that can extract the \"compositional style\" (relative position of eyes/nose/mouth regarding the canvas frame) from a single reference image and apply it to target images? I am looking for keywords or papers related to \"One-shot learning for layout/composition\" or \"Content-aware cropping based on reference.\" Any keywords, papers, or architectural advice from those who have tackled similar problems in production would be greatly appreciated.
