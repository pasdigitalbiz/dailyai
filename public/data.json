      "summary": "Currently, I’m working on a web app for managing documents, databases, and whiteboards—the typical app that aims to be like Notion. However, right now I’m facing the dilemma of creating a plan with AI usage limits, since the idea is to make it more agentic: able to edit and query context across an entire workspace and move it into a document, for example, maybe draw something on a whiteboard, etc. Still, I have the feeling that consumption could easily get out of hand. I plan to use DeepSeek for AI chat, but use Gemini 3 Flash for agentic usage and editing because it’s more intelligent. Lately, I’ve seen how many core AI apps have shifted their pricing models from per-request pricing to a fixed usage limit, but I’m unsure whether that’s frowned upon, creates a less pleasant user experience, or maybe even gives the feeling that you’re not getting what you paid for. So I’d like to hear some opinions on what decision I should make. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46866473 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Ask HN: Anyone else struggle with how to learn coding in the AI era?",
      "summary": "I'm someone who got into building/programming in early 2025, when vibe coding tools became more usable. Since then, I'd like to think that I have developed a lot as a programmer, but I still have this deep sense of imposter syndrome / worry that AI is too much of a crutch and I'm not really learning. I have shipped a few projects, I always review AI-suggested code, do daily coding practice without AI, watch youtube videos, etc. but still don't know if I'm striking the right balance or whether I can really call myself a programmer. I often see people say that the solution is to just fully learn to code without AI, (i.e, go \"cold turkey\"), which may be the best, but I wonder if the optimal path is somewhere in between given that AI is clearlly changing the game here in terms of what it means to be a programmer. I'm curious how you have all handled this balancing act in the past few years. More concretely, what strategies do you use to both be efficient and able to ship / move quickly while ensuring you are also taking the time to really process and understand and learn what you are doing?
