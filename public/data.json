      "summary": "Hey HN, I’ve been working on Scriptover, a multimodal AI assistant that helps veterinarians create SOAP notes (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) from real client conversations, images, and lab data. The idea came from my brother, a hospital director in California, who was spending hours each night writing notes after long days at the clinic. I wanted to see if AI could help vets reclaim that time while keeping medical reasoning accurate and transparent. Scriptover listens, interprets, and structures cases into clear, editable records — helping clinicians focus more on patients and less on paperwork. You can try it here → https://www.scriptover.com Happy to hear thoughts or feedback from anyone building applied AI or working on healthcare workflow tools.
