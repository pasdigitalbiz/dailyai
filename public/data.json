      "title": "Show HN: I built an AI Voice note taker transcriber",
      "summary": "Hi HN, I have been building mobile apps for about 8 years now. I built a tool iOS app to just transcribe and summarize audio recordings, meetings, lectures, seminars, doctor appointments, project showcase, event, journalism etc. It can unlimited record and transcribe, summarize and get key data, AI chat with transcription, youtube video to transcript and summary. The goal was to make something completely frictionless. There is no login required. You just open it and start recording, or paste a YouTube link to get the full transcript and AI summary instantly without having to watch the video. Under the hood, I am using the Gemini API with a custom model for the heavy lifting. The audio is kept on your device, sent to the API for processing, and then deleted within 24 hours. It is definetly not used for training any models. Main features: Audio recording and file import YouTube video to notes and summaries Chat directly with your transcripts to find specific info Supports over 100 languages Unlimited recording hours (I am trying to make the math work on a flat subscription rather than charging users per minute) Flash Cards and quiz based on transcript for learners. Since I just launched it a few days ago, I am really looking for feedbacks. Free generation and free trial is also available.\nThanks.
