      "title": "Context management is the real bottleneck in AI-assisted coding",
      "summary": "After using Cursor and Claude Code daily, I’ve noticed that when an AI coding agent drifts or forgets constraints, we assume it’s a model limitation. In many cases, it’s context management. A few observations:\n- Tokens are not just limits. They’re attention competition.\n- Even before hitting the hard window limit, attention dilution happens.\n- Coding tasks degrade faster than chat because of dependency density and multi-representation juggling (diffs, logs, tests). I started managing context deliberately:\n- Always write a contract\n- Chunk sessions by intent\n- Snapshot state and restart\n- Prefer on-demand CLI instead of preloading large MCP responses It dramatically improved the stability of the agent. Curious how others are handling context optimization. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47012302 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Show HN: Why Playwright-CLI Beats MCP for AI‑Driven Browser Automation",
      "summary": "Most “AI + browser” setups still bolt MCP tools onto Playwright and hope for the best, so every click dumps full DOMs, accessibility trees, and logs into the model. That burns tokens, collapses context, and makes long sessions unreliable. Meanwhile, default Playwright reports start to struggle once you have more than a few dozen e2e tests, so teams drown in HTML reports and flaky failures instead of clear patterns. The insights at https://testdino.com/blog/playwright-cli/ explores how Microsoft’s playwright-cli keeps browser state external, returns only compact element references and YAML flows, and works with normal npx playwright test plus smarter reporting, so both agents and humans stay fast, cost aware, and predictable.

      "title": "Show HN: Verify-before-release x402 gateway for AI agent transactions",
      "summary": "Hey HN, I built Settld because I kept running into the same problem: AI agents can call APIs, pay for services, and hire other agents - but there's no way to prove the work was actually done before the money moves. The problem in one sentence: x402 tells you \"payment was sent\". Settld tells you \"the work was worth paying for\". What it does Settld sits between your agent and the APIs/agents it pays. It: 1. Intercepts HTTP 402 (Payment Required) responses\n2. Creates an escrow hold instead of paying immediately\n3. Collects evidence that the work was completed\n4. Runs deterministic verification (same evidence + same terms = same payout, every time)\n5. Releases payment only after verification passes\n6. Issues a cryptographically verifiable receipt If verification fails or the work is disputed, the hold is refunded. The agent gets a receipt either way - a permanent, auditable record of what happened. Why this matters now We're at a weird inflection point. Coinbase shipped x402 (50M+ transactions). Google shipped A2A. Anthropic shipped MCP. Agents can discover each other, communicate, and pay each other. But nobody built the layer that answers: \"was the work actually done correctly, and how much should the payout be?\" That's the gap. Right now, every agent-to-agent transaction is either \"trust and hope\" or \"don't transact.\" Neither scales. The x402 gateway (the fastest way to try it) We ship a drop-in reverse proxy that you put in front of any API: docker run -e UPSTREAM_URL= https://your-api.com \\\n           -e SETTLD_API_URL= https://api.settld.dev \\\n           -e SETTLD_API_KEY=sk_... \\\n           -p 8402:8402 \\\n           settld/x402-gateway Everything flows through normally - except 402 responses get intercepted, escrowed, verified, and settled. Your agent gets a receipt with a hash-chained proof of what happened. What's under the hood The settlement kernel is the interesting part (and where we spent most of our time): - Deterministic policy evaluation - machine-readable agreements with release rates based on verification status (green/amber/red). No ambiguity.\n- Hash-chained event log - every event in a settlement is chained with Ed25519 signatures. Tamper-evident, offline-verifiable.\n- Escrow with holdback windows - configurable holdback basis points + dispute windows. Funds auto-release if unchallenged.\n- Dispute → arbitration → verdict → adjustment - full dispute resolution pipeline, not just \"flag for human review.\"\n- Append-only reputation events - every settlement produces a reputation event (approved, rejected, disputed, etc.). Agents build verifiable economic track records.\n- Compositional settlement - agents can delegate work to sub-agents with linked agreements. If a downstream agent fails, refunds cascade deterministically back up the chain. The whole protocol is spec'd with JSON schemas, conformance vectors, and a portable oracle: https://github.com/aidenlippert/settld/blob/main/docs/spec/R... What this is NOT - Not a payment processor - we don't move money. We decide \"if\" and \"how much\" money should move, then your existing rails (Stripe, x402, wire) execute it.\n- Not a blockchain - deterministic receipts and hash chains, but no consensus mechanism or token. Just cryptographic proofs.\n- Not an agent framework - we don't care if you use LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, or raw API calls. We're a protocol layer. Tech stack Node.js, PostgreSQL (or in-memory for dev), Ed25519 signatures, SHA-256 hashing, RFC 8785 canonical JSON. ~107 core modules, 494 tests passing. What I want from HN Honest feedback on whether this problem resonates. If you're building agent workflows that involve money, I want to know: what breaks? What's missing? What would make you actually install this?

      "summary": "“Painting” has been a key vehicle for transmitting Western civilization, whereas in China this role has been taken over by “poetry.” Painting is like a program, while poetry is more like a continually evolving set of requirements that must be aligned with over time. Perhaps world models are meant for writing programs, while large language models are meant for describing the world. Perhaps we shouldn’t make AI work for humans at all, but instead give it a space where it can create and explore freely.
