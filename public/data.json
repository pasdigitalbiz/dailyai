      "title": "Ask HN: How are you enforcing permissions for AI agent tool calls in production?",
      "summary": "I’m seeing more teams ship agentic systems that can call real tools (DB writes, deploys, email, billing, internal APIs). Most of the safety patterns I hear are prompt rules + basic validation + “human-in-the-loop for risky stuff.” My question: in a real production environment, what’s your enforcement point that the agent cannot bypass?\nLike, what actually guarantees the tool call isn’t executed unless it passes policy? Some specific things I’m curious about: Are you enforcing permissions inside each tool wrapper, at a gateway/proxy, or via centralized policy service? How do you handle identity + authorization when agents act on behalf of users? Do you log decisions separately from execution logs (so you can answer “why was this allowed?” later)? How do you roll out enforcement safely (audit-only/shadow mode -> enforcement)? What failure modes hurt most like policy bugs, agent hallucinations, prompt injection, or tool misuse? Would love to hear how people are doing this in practice (platform/security/infra teams especially) Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46740645 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",

      "summary": "Hi HN, I'm the author of NULL FUTURE. While most discussions focus on the 'replacement' aspect of AI (layoffs), I wanted to explore the 'deprecation' phase that comes first. My thesis is that we are entering an era of 'Invisible Replacement' where white-collar workers keep their titles but lose their utility, effectively becoming 'Null Workers'—paid to exist but functionally obsolete. The book explores strategies to pivot from 'Efficiency' (which AI wins) to 'Liability/Accountability' (which remains human). It's free on Amazon for the next few days. I wrote it as a survival manual rather than a business book. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the 'Liability Sponge' concept if you give it a read.
