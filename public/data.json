      "title": "Show HN: AI text rewriter with 90%+ detection pass rate",
      "summary": "Hi HN, I built a tool that rewrites AI-generated text to pass detection systems like Turnitin and CNKI (知网). Unlike simple paraphrasing tools, it uses semantic understanding to maintain meaning while removing AI fingerprints. Technical approach:\n- Analyzes sentence structure patterns typical of LLM outputs\n- Rebuilds content using varied syntax and vocabulary distributions\n- Preserves academic tone while reducing AI detection scores from 80%+ to <20% Tested on: CNKI (知网), VIP (维普), WanFang (万方), and Western detection systems Try it: https://www.yanbiai.com/tools/paper-pass?ly=hackernews Would love feedback from the community, especially on:\n1. Ethical considerations (I know this is controversial)\n2. Technical improvements to the rewriting algorithm\n3. Detection evasion vs. genuine writing assistance Free tier available for testing.
