      "title": "Ask HN: AI driven \"legacy\" Debug and Monitoring Tools",
      "summary": "When do we start incorporating AI into more “legacy” debugging and system monitoring tools. I’m thinking an AI version of ProcDump maybe called like ContextDump. It’s pulls all relevant system information, maybe even leveraging a bundle of “legacy” tools to create a context report. The context report can be attached to a bug report and agent flow on other side can pick it up and immediately become productive. Idea stems from bug reports that never have enough information on them to get anything started. Might not be needed for enterprise products or products with proper telemetry but the internal tools companies use day in and day out.

      "summary": "We run 15 AI agents on a production server with full shell access. One of them tried to rm -rf a directory it shouldn't have touched. Another started curling cloud metadata endpoints. We wrote some hardcoded rules to catch the obvious stuff, then realized we were building the same safety layer everyone else will need too. So we extracted it into a library. Vigil is a deterministic rule engine that inspects AI agent tool calls before they execute. 22 rules across 8 threat categories: destructive shell commands, SSRF, path traversal, SQL injection, data exfiltration, prompt injection, encoded payloads, and credential exposure. It's not an LLM wrapper — we don't trust an LLM to guard another LLM. Pure pattern matching, zero dependencies, <2ms per check, works completely offline. npm install vigil-agent-safety import { checkAction } from 'vigil-agent-safety';\nconst result = checkAction({\n  agent: 'my-agent',\n  tool: 'exec',\n  params: { command: 'rm -rf /' },\n});\n// result.decision → \"BLOCK\"\n// result.reason → \"Destructive command pattern\"\n// result.latencyMs → 0.3 It plugs into MCP servers, LangChain tool chains, Express middleware, or anything else. MIT licensed, no API keys, no network calls, no telemetry. This is v0.1 — probably too aggressive for some use cases. Next up is a YAML policy engine (v0.2) and an MCP proxy. We'd love feedback on the rule set, false positive experiences, and threat categories we're missing.

The core problem is that recommendations are generated from training data with zero real-world verification.I'm experimenting with a different architecture: two agents with opposing travel philosophies (deep/slow vs highlights/efficient) debate each recommendation, then every suggestion gets validated against Google Places API - real opening hours, actual walking distances, current ratings. Anything unverified gets flagged.Early stage - looking for feedback on the approach. Has anyone tried grounding LLM outputs against structured APIs like this? What's broken about it?

      "summary": "I'm really at stump here, I want to use AI to make my life easier with work but how do I if I can't trust its answers 100% of the time? I mean I understand it needs human intervention but if I don't know the answer itself, it involves me stopping at the exact time I need to, searching for the correct answer elsewhere entirely and or just giving up on it, its quite exhausting. The process for me is usually I go down a path with an LLM; I get excited at the prospect of using it as a tool. In the middle i spot an error. Question it, the LLM responds with a contradiction in the same conversation. I realise it means the last 5 minutes of dialogue was all incorrect, and I get frustrated that it wasted my time. I mean they're selling it as intelligent but where is the intelligence, to me its more akin to a search engine where instead of showing me a full article, it returns the excerpt of text instead. Useful.. maybe? I know people use this in their work daily so I'm just curious how do they do it? Do they ignore the blaring errors like they aren't there? I know this sounds sarcastic but I really want to know because especially in my own projects, I find it hard to move on from not 'perfection' per say, but anything other than bad.
