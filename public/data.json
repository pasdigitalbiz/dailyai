      "summary": "Hi HN, I’m building Kuzco, a Swift SDK for running AI models locally on Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Vision Pro). The goal is to make “offline + private AI” feel like a normal dependency you can drop into a SwiftUI/UIKit app, without standing up servers or paying per-token API fees.\nWhat it does - Text generation with token streaming (chat style UX) - Vision AI (analyze images locally) - Image generation via Stable Diffusion - Model manager to download and manage on-device models Developer experience - create a session with a model - stream tokens as they generate - optionally get a full response (There’s a code snippet on the homepage showing the exact flow.) Why I’m posting I’d love feedback from iOS devs (and anyone shipping on-device inference) on: - What would make this a “must use” SDK for you - What models you’d want supported first (small, fast, good-enough vs bigger, slower, better) - What your biggest pain is today: performance, model downloads, UX, memory, app size, safety, etc. If you want updates / early access when it’s ready to share broadly, there’s a waitlist on the site (no credit card). https://kuzco.co/ Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46699734 Points: 1 # Comments: 0",
