      "title": "Ask HN: Doctors Using AI Workflow Automation – What's the Real Impact?",
      "summary": "We see increasing integration of AI in hospitals: systems that auto-generate clinical notes from doctor‘s speech , “radiology agents” that pre-read scans , and even “digital doctor” projects for specific pathways . I‘m keen to hear from medical professionals, hospital IT staff, or developers in this field about the ground truth. What specific, repetitive tasks in your workflow have been successfully automated or augmented by AI? (E.g., documentation, coding, preliminary screening). What has been the actual effect on your daily hours, mental load, and patient interaction time? Are the promised efficiency gains real? What are the biggest frustrations? (e.g., AI “hallucinations” in notes, rigid workflows, integration nightmares with EHRs, or the time needed to review/correct AI output). Please share your honest experience, good or bad.

      "title": "Ask HN: Vibe Researching\" with AI – Anyone Using It for Real?",
      "summary": "The concept of \"vibe researching\" – using AI to rapidly explore, synthesize literature, and generate novel research ideas or frameworks – seems promising. Beyond just literature reviews, it could act as a brainstorming co-pilot. Has anyone here seriously used AI (e.g., Claude for long-context paper analysis, custom GPTs on arXiv, or specialized agents) to aid in hypothesis generation, research gap identification, or drafting substantive parts of a paper? What are the biggest pitfalls regarding accuracy, hallucination of citations, or superficial understanding of complex theory? How do you validate the AI's output? Do you see it as a legitimate accelerator for early-stage research, or more of a productivity tool for mundane tasks? Any success stories linking it to a tangible research outcome? Looking for honest experiences from academics, industry researchers, or solo discoverers. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46791551 Points: 2 # Comments: 0",

      "title": "Ask HN: Do you verify AI-generated content before publishing?",
      "summary": "I'm researching content repurposing tools and trying to understand a workflow gap: When you use AI to turn podcasts/interviews/webinars into social posts, do you verify accuracy before publishing? Context: Tools like Castmagic and Descript are 85-95% accurate. That 5-15% error rate means AI sometimes:\n- Misquotes speakers\n- Paraphrases in ways that change meaning\n- Attributes quotes to wrong person (multi-speaker issue) I've found two camps: Camp A: \"I carefully verify everything\"\n- Re-read transcripts or scrub audio\n- Takes 20-30 minutes per post\n- Zero tolerance for publishing errors Camp B: \"I trust AI and publish\"\n- \"Good enough\" for social media\n- Errors are rare enough to accept\n- Speed > perfection My questions:\n1. Which camp are you in?\n2. If Camp A: what's your verification workflow?\n3. Has anyone been burned by publishing inaccurate AI content?\n4. Would \"click any quote to hear exact audio timestamp\" be valuable? Building a tool that links every generated claim to source evidence. Trying to validate if this solves a real problem or if I'm overthinking content accuracy. Appreciate any insights from the HN community.
