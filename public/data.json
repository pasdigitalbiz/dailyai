      "title": "Show HN: Yori – Isolating AI Logic into \"Semantic Containers\" (Docker for Code)",
      "summary": "Hi HN,\nI've been a developer for some time now, and like many of you, I've been frustrated by the \"All-or-Nothing\" problem with AI coding tools. You ask an AI to fix a bug or implement a function, and it rewrites the whole file. It changes your imports, renames your variables, or deletes comments it deems unnecessary. It’s like giving a junior developer (like me) root access to your production server just to change a config file. So, 29 days ago, I started building Yori to solve the trust problem. The Concept: Semantic Containers\nYori introduces a syntax that acts like a firewall for AI. You define a $${ ... }$$ block inside a text file. Outside the block (The Host): Your manual code, architecture, and structure. The AI cannot touch this.\nInside the block (The Container): You write natural language intent. The AI can only generate code here. Example: myutils.md ```cpp\nEXPORT: \"myfile.cpp\" // My manual architecture - AI cannot change this\n#include \"utils.h\" void process_data() {\n    // Container: The AI is sandboxed here, but inherits the rest of the file as context\n    $${\n      Sort the incoming data vector using quicksort.\n      Filter out negative numbers.\n      Print the result.\n    }$$ \n}\nEXPORT: END\n```\nHow it works:\nYori is a C++ wrapper that parses these files. Whatever is within the EXPORT block and outside the containers ($${ }$$) will be copied as it is. When you run `yori myutils.md -make -series`, it sends the prompts to a local (Ollama) or cloud LLM, generates the syntax, fills the blocks, and compiles the result using your native toolchain (GCC/Clang/Python). If compilation fails, it feeds the error back to the LLM in a retry loop (self-healing). Why I think this matters: 1. Safety: You stop giving AI \"root access\" to your files. 2. Intent as Source: The prompt stays in the file. If you want to port your logic from C++ to Rust, you keep the prompts and just change the compile target. 3. Incremental Builds (to be added soon): Named containers allow for caching. If the prompt hasn't changed, you don't pay for an API call. It’s open source (MIT), C++17, and works locally. I’d love feedback on the \"Semantic Container\" concept. Is this the abstraction layer we've been missing for AI coding? Let me hear your ideas. Also, if you can't run yori.exe tell what went wrong and we see how to fix it. I opened a github issue on this. I am also working in making documentation for the project (github wiki). So expect that soon. GitHub: https://github.com/alonsovm44/yori Thanks! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46998870 Points: 3 # Comments: 0",
