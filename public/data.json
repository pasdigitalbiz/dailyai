      "summary": "Hey — Looking for feedback on my AI cost-optimization + “AI Slop Prevention” tool\nI'm Zach, and I’ve been building AI features for a while now. Like many of you, I started noticing the same painful problems every time I shipped anything that used LLMs.\n The problem (from a developer’s perspective)\nAI bills get out of control fast. Even if you log usage, you still can't answer:\n• “Which model is burning money?”\n• “Why did this prompt suddenly cost 10× more?”\n• “Is this output identical to something we already generated?”\n• “Should this request even go to GPT-4, or would Groq/Claude suffice?”\n• “Why did the LLM produce 3,000 tokens of slop when I asked for 200?”\n• “How do I give my team access without accidentally giving them access to ruin my budget?”\nAnd then there’s AI Slop — unnecessary tokens, verbose responses, hallucinated filler text, or redundant reasoning chains that waste tokens without adding value.\nMost teams have no defense against it.\nI got tired of fighting this manually, so I started building something small… and it turned into a real product.\n Introducing PricePrompter Cloud\nA lightweight proxy + devtool that optimizes AI cost, reduces token waste, and prevents AI slop — without changing how you code.\nYou keep your existing OpenAI/Anthropic calls. We handle the optimization layer behind the scenes.\n What it does\n1⃣ Smart Routing (UCG Engine)\nSend your AI request to PricePrompter → we send it to the cheapest model that satisfies your quality requirements.\n• GPT-4 → Claude-Sonnet if equivalent\n• GPT-3.5 style → Groq if faster/cheaper\n• Or stay on your preferred model with cost warnings\nYour code stays unchanged.\n2⃣ FREE Semantic Caching\nWe automatically store/recognize semantically similar requests and return cached results when safe.\nYou get real observability:\n• Cache hits\n• Cache misses\n• Percentage matched\n• Total savings\nCaching will always remain free.\n3⃣ AI Slop Prevention Engine\nThis is one of the features I’m most excited about.\nWe detect:\n• Overlong responses\n• Repeated sections\n• Chain-of-thought that isn’t needed\n• Redundant reasoning\n• Token inflation\n• Hallucinated filler\nAnd we trim, constrain, or guide the LLM to reduce token waste before the request hits your billing.\nThink of it as:\n“Linting for LLM calls.”\n4⃣ Developer Tools (Cursor-style SDK)\nA VS Code extension + SDK that gives you:\n• Cost per request (live)\n• Alternative model suggestions\n• Token breakdown\n• “Why this request was expensive” explanation\n• Model routing logs\n• Usage analytics directly in your editor\nNo need to open dashboards unless you want deeper insights.\n5⃣ Team & Enterprise Governance\nPractical controls for growing teams:\n• Spending limits\n• Model-level permissions\n• Approval for high-cost requests\n• PII masking\n• Key rotation\n• Audit logs\n• Team-level reporting\nNothing enterprise-y in a bad way — just the stuff dev teams actually need.\n Who this is for\n• Developers building LLM features\n• SaaS teams using expensive models\n• Startups struggling with unpredictable OpenAI bills\n• Agencies running multi-client workloads\n• Anyone experimenting with multi-model routing\n• Anyone who wants visibility into token usage\n• Anyone tired of “AI slop” blowing up their costs\n What I’m looking for:\nI’d love real feedback from developers:\n• Would you trust a proxy that optimizes your LLM cost?\n• Is AI slop prevention actually useful in your workflow?\n• Is free semantic caching valuable?\n• What would make this a must-have devtool?\n• What pricing model makes sense for you?\n• Any dealbreakers or concerns?\nStill shaping the MVP — so your input directly influences what gets built next.\nHappy to answer questions or share a preview.\nThanks ! \n— Zach Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46240030 Points: 1 # Comments: 2",
