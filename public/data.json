      "title": "Ask HN: How can we make use of AI agents with existing GitLab CI/CD pipelines?",
      "summary": "We currently utilize GitLab CI/CD pipelines to deploy our Kubernetes clusters. I am planning to integrate AI agents to gather cluster-related data and automate the deployment process. I am considering two primary approaches: Replacing GitLab CI/CD with Agentic Workflows: Is this a reliable strategy? With GitLab, we can easily rerun a pipeline from the point of failure after fixing an issue. I am concerned that agentic workflows might lack this granular state management and retry capability. Invoking GitLab CI/CD via Agents: In this scenario, the agent would trigger the GitLab API to start a pipeline or job. However, this seems to add more complexity than simply triggering them manually. How can I implement this efficiently? Ultimately, my goal is to use agents to eliminate manual pre-pipeline preparation and to have them autonomously analyze and fix errors when a pipeline fails. Has anyone successfully implemented AI agents for this purpose? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46597509 Points: 1 # Comments: 1",
