      "title": "How to use AI to augment learning without losing critical thinking skills?",
      "summary": "Lately I have been using AI more in my day to day learning. I typically use it to generate boilerplate code, ask it to explain some concept I’m having trouble grasping in an easier way and fact checking what it says while asking for deeper clarification (why is something done this way, what are others ways it can be done, comparing and contrasting etc. I basically use it as a tutor. I don’t use it to really “do” anything for me. I program most everything by hand and anything that has to do with problem solving I do myself. But I won’t lie and say I’m not scared of becoming reliant on AI. I think the way I’m using it is pretty good. Improve learning while continue to apply knowledge myself. But I’d like to know where I can improve my AI usage and how you guys are using AI in your workflow. It’s giving me a great deal of anxiety when I read articles about how AI will kill critical thinking skills and what not. I don’t want to avoid it. But I don’t want it to make me stupid.
