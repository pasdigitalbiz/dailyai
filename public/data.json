      "summary": "This feels strange to admit. I notice that sometimes I speak to AI systems like they are a friend. I know they are not real. I know there is no person on the other side. Still my brain acts like there is. I feel a small emotional connection. I see comments online saying this happens to others too. I am trying to understand if this is a new psychological effect or if humans always did this with new technology. Maybe it is the same as talking to pets or giving names to cars. Or maybe it is something deeper. Why do you think this happens. Is it loneliness. Is it empathy misfiring. Is it design tricks. Is it harmless or dangerous. I am curious how the HN crowd sees it.

      "summary": "I asked versions of this question to a few different models but I never found an accurate answer. I would like to compare the various free and paid AI subscription plans, primarily from the most popular vendors like ChatGPT, Claude, Google, etc. I can find countless static webpages, YouTube videos, etc. that compare subscriptions, but their information quickly becomes out-of-date, or isn't detailed enough. I'm looking for a tool that grabs the latest information on what each plan provides (features, models, context windows, etc.), and compares them across different subscriptions. I imagine this information would be obtained from API calls or scraping. The comparison tool should not rely on AI to get its information.. I want the latest facts (ideally checked at least once a day). Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46388007 Points: 3 # Comments: 1",
